"Salted Caramel Core,Sweettooth909,2020-01-05,5,I’m OBSESSED with this pint!,3,0,""I decided to try it out although I’m not a huge caramel fan, and the first buy was ok, didn’t like the caramel too much and for some reason that specific pint barely had any brownies! Like there were some on top but from the middle to the bottom? Zilch. Nada. Nothing! It was disappointing. But for some reason, I bought it again and I really do believe it was just that point bcuz the second one was glorious!! I had a big brownie chunk in EVERY bite. Plus the caramel didn’t bother me as much and I took a liking to it. Conclusion: I’m on my fifth pint, of the week and I’m going back to get my daily pint cus I’m kinda sick and need some happiness.""";;;
"Salted Caramel Core,LaTanga71,2018-04-26,3,My favorite...More Caramel Please,5,2,""My caramel core begins to disappear about half way through. I only buy this for the caramel core. The first time I purchased this I was not even aware that there were blonde bits in there. You had me a salted caramel core, well this is the fourth pint that I have purchased and the caramel is plentiful at the top then it begins to get sparse about half way down at 3/4s of the way down its gone. It works out in my husbands favor because he doesn't care for the caramel so he gets to finish my pint while having a full pint of his choice. Please please please, its called salted caramel core for a reason. Let the caramel flow through the core. P.S. You could put a little extra in there, I totally would not mind.""";;;
"Salted Caramel Core,chicago220,2018-01-14,5,Obsessed!!!,24,1,""Why are people complaining about the blonde brownies? If you don’t like blonde brownies, get ice cream with fudge brownies! I LOVE the blonde brownies and cannot get enough of them. This ice cream is by far my favorite. I have driven to multiple stores to try and find it... and when I do, I stock up! I’ve tried other flavors when I can’t find this one, and none of them even come close to making me as happy as this does! I’d say sometimes the caramel to brownie ratio is a little off at times (more brownies please!), but I’ll still always enjoy it nevertheless!""";;;
"Salted Caramel Core,Kassidyk,2020-07-24,1,Worst Ice Cream Ever!,1,5,""This ice cream is worst ice cream I’ve ever tasted. I was beyond excited when I picked it up today and couldn’t wait to get home and try it. First the sweet cream ice cream has no flavour. But that’s fine I could get past that, but the salted caramel core is what’s really wrong. It’s disgusting and so salty it’s actually inedible. I’ve had ice cream before that I have really enjoyed but never to the point where I physically can not stomach it. I love salted caramel but this is just another level. I actually came here to read the reviews and see how others thought of it just in case mine was a bad batch. Never again!""";;;
"Salted Caramel Core,Nikiera,2020-07-23,2,Way Too Salty,3,1,""I bought this last night to go with Louisiana Crunch cake because I was craving that salty and sweet flavor. Unfortunately, I was not thrilled with the salted caramel core of this ice cream. Usually, when you have salted caramel, the salt enhances the flavor of the caramel. The salt in this core OVERWHELMED everything, even the cake. It was disappointing to not enjoy my dessert and I doubt I'll be finishing this pint of ice cream, which is a shame because you should never have to throw away ice cream.""";;;
"Salted Caramel Core,Mmelvin,2017-05-28,3,""Love this flavor, but..."",3,3,""This is definitely my favorite flavor, but recently, it does not have enough blonde brownie chunks. I'll go through at least half of the pint with just 1 or 2 chunks. It looks like plain ice cream with a salted caramel core. This has happened a lot lately, and it's so dissapointing. I've gotten to the point where I simply stopped buying it. Today, purchased two because they were on sale. It started the way it should be, with plenty of yummy chunks. Before I even got halfway as I was serving myself, no more chunks. After some digging around, I found 3 more way at the bottom. Please fix this! I love this ice cream, but it's pointless without the chunks.""";;;
"Salted Caramel Core,Shay10,2017-07-02,3,Really Wanted To Love This,4,1,""I am not a chocolate person at all, and this was my very first time trying Ben & Jerry's, (Shame on me I'm 23 lol) so I was so excited to find a Caramel Ice Cream with BLONDE Brownie chunks instead of fudge. I really wanted to like this ice cream but I just couldn't. The Salted Caramel is a little too salty, In fact, I couldn't even eat the core, I just ate around it. I didn't really like the Sweet Cream Ice Cream, it didn't really have a taste to me, (Maybe Vanilla would be better). The only thing I loved about this Ice Cream were the Blonde Brownie Chunks, They were so delicious! I would love for this Ice Cream Recipe to be worked on, maybe I'll give it a try again in the future.""";;;
Salted Caramel Core,RosaT777,2019-02-12,3,Salted Caramel core had NO CARAMEL,1,1,I love all the Ben & Jerry’s flavor. But recently I been so disappointed of my favorite flavor salted core caramel. It has no core;;;
Salted Caramel Core,Realeyes,2019-06-02,2,Caramel ended 1/2 way through,0,1,The ice cream really didn’t taste like anything significant and then the caramel which carried the whole dessert ended half way through the cup :( very disappointed!;;;
Salted Caramel Core,Nicole V,2019-08-23,1,Core went about an inch into the pint,0,2,The core was absolutely delicious for about a scoop of icecream. Then there was no core for the entire rest of the pint. Huge disappointment.;;;
"Salted Caramel Core,deva,2018-02-15,3,good on top...not so good the further down you get,3,2,""I've seen this flavor multiple times at the grocery store the past few months and been tempted, finally pulled the trigger last week.""";;;
Salted Caramel Core,BJBLU,2019-09-03,3,Why aren’t the brownie bits chewy?,0,1,Hello. I just bought my 4th and 5th pints of salted caramel core while awaiting Hurricane Dorian to arrive. I will have to say that my son and I greatly enjoyed the first 3. Plenty of salty caramel (yum) and plenty of brownie bits that were chewy to the bite. However these last 2 pints that I just purchased do have plenty of caramel and brownie bits but they aren’t chewy. They are more crumbly to the bite. I’m not sure if the first 3 were a fluke or these last 2 weren’t right. Is the brownie supposed to be chewy or crumbly? These last 2 were disappointing for us and makes me question whether we should buy this kind again.;;;
"Salted Caramel Core,Buffaloed,2020-06-24,5,No Regrets!,0,0,""So it's the middle of June and I made an impromptu decision to get a small thing of ice cream during my shopping trip. I initially was thinking of going for a strawberry or peach flavor, but then I saw this pint and had a double take. I'd never try this flavor prior and man, I do not regret it. I love this pint. I love sweet cream and blonde brownie so this was a win-win. I like how to salted caramel is in the center so I have the ability to control how much I want in each bite. I do agree that the salted caramel is a bit on the salty side, but like I said, I have the control to put as little as I want in my scoop.""";;;
"Salted Caramel Core,Calla,2018-03-15,5,Perfection!,1,1,""I'll be completely honest, I'm not generally a fan of caramel (it's just too sweet for me) but I gave this flavor a shot because of the sweet cream ice cream. As it turns out, the saltiness of the caramel core perfectly balances out the sweetness! I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the salted caramel core. The blonde brownie chunks were also a nice touch and not too overwhelming. I feel like the ratio of mix ins to chunks was nicely balanced.""";;;
Salted Caramel Core,April DD,2020-03-07,5,Wow just wow,0,0,Okay I was expecting an almost too salty weirdly over sweet ice cream but man was I wrong!!! No seriously!!! I started eating this ice cream and was transported to the first time I had gooey caramel pop corn... the ice cream was like eating sweet corn creamy and smooth and the chewy bits supposed to be brownie tasted like caramel pop corn that had gotten chewy and sweet soaked in ice cream.. then the salty caramel center was too good to even say but together the best caramel pop corn ice cream I have ever had.. even though I don’t know if that’s what they were going for lol.. my favorite flavor so far;;;
"Salted Caramel Core,FuzzyGut,2018-06-29,4,""So good, but..."",2,1,""This was my 1st pint of Salted Caramel Core but not my first Ben and Jerry’s Core pint. My first impression was that my core was HUGE! It was literally overflowing when I opened the pint! Wow! And the caramel itself was delicious";" salty sweet and gooey! The sweet cream ice cream was very rich and cut through the sweet of the core nicely. My only issue was the blonde brownie bits. It’s not that they weren’t plentiful, I just really didn’t like the taste of them, which is sad because the rest of the pint was KILLER! The chocolate brownies in the other flavors are amazingly good so I was disappointed that these blonde ones weren’t very good and I ate around them. So, all in all, it was a good pint with amazing caramel, good ice cream and funky brownies.""";;
Salted Caramel Core,jordan3896,2019-03-03,2,Too much,0,2,I love carmel so much and as soon as I saw carmel core I grabbed it off the shelf. The carmel tastes great and I love the ice cream and blonde brownie pieces in it!!! The only thing that is wrong with it is how much carmel they gave me. It was 3/4 carmel and 1/4 ice cream. It wasn’t a good balance and I probably won’t get it again.;;;
"Salted Caramel Core,CollegeGal,2019-04-14,5,My Favorite Flavor- One of a Kind,1,1,""I always wanted a flavor of ice cream that was tailored to the way my taste buds worked. Most ice cream flavors from other companies that have cookie dough in it is chocolate based, but Ben & Jerry’s has cornered the market: this cookie dough is caramel and butter and cookie based (or blondie if that’s the correct term)! I’ve been buying it almost every weekend at college for a year! Please keep this flavor, it makes me so happy. The fact that there’s a cookie dough flavor that is chocolate free is one of a kind and not many ice companies make that!""";;;
Salted Caramel Core,Margot,2020-04-19,1,Core more like pencil line,0,1,I was so excited to try the “core” pints. The picture they show online makes it look like a decent size and width. The reality: the core of my salted caramel pint was the width of a pencil eraser tip. Incredibly disappointing and 100% not as advertised. I feel duped.;;;
"Salted Caramel Core,ne26,2018-06-19,3,Core-full?,0,1,""I bought this on sale and was excited to try it. While the ice cream is light and blondies are a nice treat, I wish there was more of a salted caramel core. Mine did not go down even halfway, which is a pity because I love salted caramel.""";;;
Salted Caramel Core,Rileyhd,2017-10-14,2,Not terrible,0,2,I had to buy this to since they were all out of mint at the store...lots of Carmel Core which was a plus but no blondie chunks!!! Any were so tiny...very disappointed because Ben and jerrys rocks!!;;;
Salted Caramel Core,Pasz,2017-08-15,3,Why,0,2,I love this but where did my core go??????????????;;;
Salted Caramel Core,TimR,2018-02-07,3,Salty Caramel?,1,0,I know sweet cream ice cream probably wouldn't be a big seller but I wish B&J would make more flavors with a sweet cream base or just a plain sweet cream ice cream. When the flavor was 1st introduced I used to get this regularly but it got to a point I was throwing away most of the caramel because it was too salty. I will still occasionally purchase as there are no other flavors with sweet cream.;;;
"Salted Caramel Core,Cranky Yankee,2019-01-26,3,Too salty,1,0,""Bought this recently because my local target has stopped carrying Blondie Ambition, which was my favorite. I love the sweet-cream ice cream";" my container didn't seem to have very many blondie chunks (which was disappointing, see previous) and the salted caramel core was overly salty. It was okay. I might buy it again but would rather have Blondie Ambition.""";;
"Salted Caramel Core,karen511,2017-09-18,2,Ok..,1,0,""I really wanted to like this flavor but it was quite disappointing. Halfway into the pint, the core pretty much disappeared. There was way too much at the top and it wasn't dispersed evenly throughout the ice cream. The caramel was also way too salty for my tastes. Also wished there were more brownie pieces, only found a few in the entire pint.""";;;

"Salted Caramel Core,Tornado7,2018-03-29,1,So disappointed!,1,0,""I had a major craving for ice cream so of course I had to go to the store for some Ben and Jerry's! I was really excited about this flavor, but after a few bites I was gagging. It was too salty and there were barely any brownie chunks :/ I'm really sad this ice cream is going to go waste, but I'm not happy with my purchase at all.""";;;
Salted Caramel Core,Sunrise,2017-07-14,2,Blondie Crumbs,1,0,Just bought this last night and like some of the other reviews there were only a few flecks of blondie. Mine was nothing like the photos. And so the combination of just ice cream and such salty caramel was disappointing and unbalanced. I don't know if the core extended to the bottom since I didn't eat enough to find out.;;;
"Salted Caramel Core,JandM,2018-05-06,2,So Disappointed :(,1,1,""I never thought I would not like a Ben & Jerry's flavor, but it's happened :( When my store didn't have my favorite flavor, I thought I would try the Salted Caramel Core - the description sounded great. Unfortunately, the caramel was *way* too salty - I ended up scooping it all out. The vanilla ice cream was good, but the brownie pieces had no flavor. I've never been disappointed by Ben & Jerry's before, but I guess there's a first for everything :(""";;;
"Salted Caramel Core,ASaltyFan,2018-07-07,2,They sure meant it when it said salted,1,0,""The salted caramel core tastes like someone went a little too salt happy. There was just too much core in ratio with the ice cream an in addition to the bad core to ice cream ratio, the core was just too salty to handle. Please fix the core because the ice cream itself with the blonde brownie bits are delicious.""";;;
"Salted Caramel Core,elephantsforever3,2019-02-14,1,""Horrible pint, bland brownies"",2,2,""I was excited for this ice cream because I love blondies and caramel, but it was the one flavor I've tried that I strongly dislike. The core didn't go deep at all and it was SO salty that it made me feel kind of sick. The brownies were dry and sparce and I barely could taste them. The base was alright, I guess. Really dissapointed. I think this flavor needs to be fixed or just stopped being made.""";;;
"Salted Caramel Core,Rudy58,2019-08-12,5,Best B&J Pint ever!,0,1,""I've been hooked on this flavor for more than 2 weeks now. I wish I'd have known about it sooner lol! The Salted Caramel Core is very good and the Blonde Brownies make this product over the top. I do have one complaint though. I buy maybe 4 pints or more a week and everytime I open one and start eating them they are all different as far as how many brownie peices there are or the caramel. Sometimes there's a ton of salted caramel at the top which can be overwhelming and then it's gone half way down. Other times it's normal until you get about halfway and there nothing but the sweet cream ice cream with no caramel or brownies. It's always different, however I'm still in love with this flavor and I highly recommend it! Please B&J see if y'all can get them all the same lol""";;;
"Salted Caramel Core,atik,2017-11-16,3,Too salty,1,0,""The blondie mix ins and sweet cream ice cream were nice, but I really wasn't a fan of the caramel core, because it was far too salty. You've got multiple reviews saying that it's too salty, please don't skim over those reviews. Please consider tweaking the recipe on this one so it's less salty.""";;;
"Salted Caramel Core,jessiraes,2018-06-07,2,Good in theory...,1,0,""I usually love salted caramel foods, and I adore Ben & Jerry's decadent ice creams. The ice cream was excellent, the brownie pieces were yummy, but the caramel tasted way too salty! The salt is supposed to compliment the caramel, not overpower it. I'm pretty disappointed.""";;;
"Salted Caramel Core,Linda895,2018-04-04,3,Too salty,1,0,""I love anything caramel. I was super excited when I saw the whole core was salted caramel. However it was way too salty, I even tried mixing it with the sweet cream ice cream and it was still too salty. It could also use more of the brownie, which was certainly delicious.""";;;
"Salted Caramel Core,Aggs,2017-06-08,5,My all time favorite ice cream!!!,1,1,""I.JUST.LOVE this ice cream!!! if I eat ice cream, it must always be B&J salted caramel core! I think I'm addicted. It's a perfect combination between sweet and salty, plus delicious caramel and chewy chunks. I noticed that some pints don't have that much chunks but the vanilla ice cream itself is pretty yummy and honestly, I cannot stay mad for long haha! If B&J's ever discontinue this flavor, I think it could be the end of my world!""";;;
"Salted Caramel Core,Andrew5,2017-04-12,5,Absolutely fantastic,2,2,""I bought this ice cream simply based on the fact that I was craving caramel. But with this wonderful ice cream, you get so much more. Not only is the Ice cream and blonde Brownies perfect...but the caramel is just so good. You almost want to save the caramel as long as you can because how perfect the flavor is. It's the perfect amounts of sweet and salty.""";;;
"Salted Caramel Core,Curt,2018-03-08,1,Way too salty,2,1,""There must have been some sort of mistake with the amount of salt mixed into the caramel. Nobody would but that much saint into a desert.

Salted Caramel Core,Sheyla1110,2018-03-09,2,SALTY!!!,1,0,Tried this flavor for the first time about two weeks ago it was delicious; But today I’m extremely disappointed. The core is so salty in this pint. I had other people try and they also agreed it was too salty. Don’t think I’m buying again.;;
"Salted Caramel Core,Margaret,2018-09-07,2,Too salty,1,0,""I am a lover of all things caramel, and while the ice cream and the blonde bites were delicious, I found myself eating around the core because it was just too salty. Tasted like caramel flavored salt. Very disappointed in this flavor.""";;;
Salted Caramel Core,Ohlivia,2017-06-05,5,I love it I love it.,2,1,Salted caramel core is in my top three. My eating tactic is to scoop the ice cream from the outside and then smash the back of the spoon into the core so when I take a bite the first thing I'm hit with is salty and then it's sweet.;;;
"Salted Caramel Core,Atsoli,2018-06-03,1,Horrible!,1,0,""My daughter picked up this flavor for me to try because I love Carmel. I have to say, this is the worst flavor I have ever had. The blonde fudge was bland but the salted Carmel was the worst. It was so salty that I couldn't eat it.""";;;

Salted Caramel Core,Mpitts,2017-05-21,1,Not a fan of brownie chunks,1,0,I really can't stand the flavors with chunks of cookie/brownie. It seems like I'm eating something stale. I'm in the minority but I stopped going to a convenience store near me because all they carried were those types.;;;
"Salted Caramel Core,Raebirds,2019-01-28,3,Too Salty for my buds,1,0,""I had high hopes for this flavor, but the carmel core was way too salty. I was hoping for a sweeter kraft caramel taste. The blonde brownie bites were just okay...not much traditional brownie flavor. Won’t buy again.""";;;
Salted Caramel Core,Iceicecream430,2018-02-11,1,Don’t buy this one!,1,0,I absolutely love Ben and Jerrys ice cream but this one was horrible. The picture looks like there will be tons and brownies and there were only 5 tiny bites in the whole pint. The caramel core was overly salty too.;;;
Salted Caramel Core,gilderoy,2019-07-12,1,the worst thing to ever be in my mouth,1,0,the caramel tastes like salty death. I think I have sodium poisoning from one bite. Gross as heck like why would you do this to people. Who let this pass the taste test??? Fr fr are y’alls tongues blind?;;;
"Salted Caramel Core,MikeA128,2017-10-30,3,Used to love! Keyword’s “used to”,0,1,""I found the salted caramel core shortly after discovering Karamel Sutra. Needless to say I fell in love! The flavors were amazing and the gooey salted caramel and blondie chunks went perfect together. Until the last 12, yes I said 12! Pints I bought, all fell short. They either had very few brownie chunks, the core stopped halfway through, or there was a pocket of air at the bottom where caramel should have been. I give up! I want my salted caramel, but not at 4.50/pt to be left unhappy.""";;;

"Salted Caramel Core,Drew C,2018-09-09,3,Almost Delicious,0,1,""the flavors are great and they work well together. Unfortunately, they do not work well with the core concept. The caramel would be much better if it were evenly distributed throughout the ice cream, rather than isolated in one huge pool. The blondies could pack a bit more flavor as well. So far, I have yet to have a variety of Ben & Jerry's core flavors that would not taste better if the flavors were evenly distributed. They almost taste like a cheap Ben & Jerry's knockoff.""";;;
Salted Caramel Core,USAFVeteran87,2017-06-27,2,Great but really salty in the caramel core...,1,1,I bought this favor couple of days ago and thought what could be bad about a salted caramel core.

Salted Caramel Core,Chickenleg,2020-04-10,5,The best thing I’ve ever put in my mouth,0,0,This was the best ice cream I’ve ever tasted. The salted Carmel mixed with the sweet cream ice cream is Devine. When you hit a blonde piece it’s the most delicious mouth watering bite. I would recommend this ice cream to everyone I know. I could live off of this for the rest of my life and be content. I stalked up on these pints during quarantine. Ben and Jerry please sponsor me.;;;
"Salted Caramel Core,RKH123,2020-06-11,1,Salted caramel with emphasis on the SALTED,0,0,""The core concept is great because you get a lot of one key component. I normally love salted caramel. However, the caramel core in this ice cream is so salty I can't eat it. It isn't even a matter of mixing it together with the other ingredients to maybe make it taste better than it does in isolation. The salt just overpowers everything!""";;;
Salted Caramel Core,SaltedCaramelFan,2017-10-17,5,Excellent blend of flavors,0,1,I’m tempted to give a bad review to see if they “reach out to me to make it right” by giving free ice cream...;;;
"Salted Caramel Core,Angie38,2018-04-29,1,Tastes spoiled,0,1,""I got a pint of this ice cream and i had to throw it out. It had an awful taste and the brownies were really gross and chewy";" I spit it out and it left an awful after-taste. I checked the date on the carton and it’s good until 2019, so I’m not sure what happened but the ice cream was the worst I’ve ever eaten. Won’t get that again.""";;
"Salted Caramel Core,Gal Friday,2019-03-18,5,Possibly my favorite flavor!!,0,1,""I'm very surprised by the low reviews on this flavor. It is absolutely delicious. The caramel core is what makes this one so special. You can enjoy it all the way down to the end of the pint. It could use more blondie chunks (bigger ones, too) but this didn't detract enough for me to take away any stars. I LOVE this flavor.""";;;
Salted Caramel Core,Trina,2018-03-05,4,Taste Amazing BUT...,0,1,I love the flavor combo of this ice cream but I just wanted more brownie pieces. I found myself trying to dig out what few pieces were in middle of my pint. Just a little disappointed. I just wanted more :( The overall taste of the ice cream was on point. I don't think a little more brownie chunks will mess that up. Thanks!;;;
"Salted Caramel Core,Jarrett,2017-08-22,4,Almost perfect!,0,1,""Ok so this was my first 'core' Ben and Jerry's. It was awesome. I love the experience of mixing the ice cream with the caramel. But where were the blondies? They were few and far between each bite. I was very excited about it everytime I managed to find a small piece. Also, are the blondies made by Greyston Bakery?""";;;
Salted Caramel Core,Shotgunshell,2018-01-22,5,Best ice cream in the history of cream!,0,1,My husband brought it home a few months ago and now im addicted! It's so good i as in hospital having brain surgery and it's all I wanted! I give up meals so i can eat it. I don't like chocolate so it's so hard to find blonde brownies and salted carmel without chocolate. If I had a last meal it would be it!;;;
"Salted Caramel Core,PhoenixRises,2019-09-03,5,My Favorite Core Ice Cream!,0,1,""This one is my favorite out of the cores! I'm a lover of caramel and a lover of blondie brownies so of course this is a win! I can't see how the average rating is only 3.5. I don't get it. I don't know what people are tasting, because this is delicious. PLEASE don't get rid of this flavor!! I NEED it!""";;;
"Salted Caramel Core,parkesea,2017-11-12,5,SO GOOD,0,1,""I LOVE this flavour. Salted caramel and blonde brownies are my favourite thing, and to find them in ice cream was a dream come true. The only thing I wish was different: I know """"Salted"""" Caramel is the name of the flavour, but it really was too salty - so much so that I found it kind of off-putting.""";;;
"Salted Caramel Core,Corbin,2017-10-04,2,""Great potential, but lacking in brownies."",0,1,""Tastes great and has so much potential, but the 6 pints of ice cream that I bought-all had a core of caramel with a couple of blonde brownies but nothing like I expected. It fell short of my expectations and I can't justify spending $5 a pint for ice cream that isn't chock-full of gooey goodness.""";;;
Salted Caramel Core,Raee,2020-04-22,3,Finally something not chocolate!,0,0,This was a dream come true when I found it in stores. I was so excited!! I barely made it home. BUT... disappointment hit me in the face when I almost died at how salty the caramel is. Wow. Not enough brownies. I guess I'll keep searching for my perfect flavor. I wish you could Exchange icecream.;;;
Salted Caramel Core,jasg517,2019-03-31,4,Tastes Great but Caramel is too Salty,0,1,I got this a few days ago just to try. I really loved it!! The blondie brownies are so yummy. I really enjoyed the ice cream overall. However the salted caramel core was a little too salty for the ice cream. I couldn’t really eat all the caramel with the ice cream like I wanted too;;;
"Salted Caramel Core,Abp87,2020-07-10,5,Can’t get enough of this ice cream,0,0,""This ice cream. Y’all. This ice cream. The perfectly salted gooey caramel, the chewy chunks of blondie... ermahgerd. The worst part of this is we can barely find it anymore. BEN AND JERRY I swear to you if you get rid of this in the middle of a pandemic... I will never forgive you.""";;;
"Salted Caramel Core,Ben123,2017-05-20,4,""Really, Really GOOD"",0,1,""I am writing this review as I enjoy a pint of this very ice cream. It is delicious and the flavors go very well together. The only problem was, though, that the caramel was waaay too salty, so I ended up eating around it. Nontheless, it was really good and I hope to buy it again.""";;;
Salted Caramel Core,sarah7,2017-10-25,3,good but can use a little help,0,1,I think the sweet cream and caramel are great but I have bought this a couple times and the brownies just are off on taste. I feel like choc brownies would be better or to even leave them out. Far from gross but not as good as other ice cream which is a bummer with the price.;;;
"Salted Caramel Core,Kyure,2020-04-23,5,Perfection!!,0,0,""By far my favorite pint ever! Not to mention, SUPER addicting!!! The blond brownies are the beeeeessst, and with caramel? Truly my only companion in this quarantine, so i stocked up. World War IV could break out and as long as I have my daily B&J pints I’d survive just fine.""";;;
Salted Caramel Core,Jewels30,2017-06-04,1,Caramel Core????,0,1,I bought this for the caramel core the first time and it was great. The second time with was a dollop of caramel on top. The third time an even smaller dollop. If you like just vanillia ice cream a little bit of caramel this is the ice cream for you. I am very disappointed.;;;
Salted Caramel Core,Newks,2020-04-25,5,It’s my favorite!,0,0,I bought this about a month ago and have gotten two more containers since. I would not say it’s a flavor for everyone but I love it. I love salted Carmel. The salt pairs nicely with the sweet ice cream and blondies! But if you don’t like salty sweetness this is not for you.;;;
"Salted Caramel Core,MicktyMac,2018-12-15,4,Perfect,0,1,""I am allergic to coco beans so finding a tasty ice cream with out any chocolate can become quite the hassle. When I, thankfully, came across this ice cream I was over the moon. The only problem I have with it is that I can't find it in any stores when I go search for it.""";;;
"Salted Caramel Core,SadPint831,2018-06-30,2,""Disappointed, false advertising"",0,1,""First time buying a pint of salted caramel core. I was so excited! I immediately noticed a lack of blonde brownies and about half way through the pint, the caramel core disappeared. It looks nothing like the picture! There was a total of maybe 5 or 6 blondie pieces.""";;;
"Salted Caramel Core,KirstenBuckeye,2017-08-05,4,""First time wasn't love, second time was love!"",0,1,The first time I tried this I thought it was wayyy too salty. I gave it another try a few weeks later and I love it now. The trick is to have a tiny bite of caramel with the ice cream since sometimes the core has a lot of caramel and sometimes it just has a little.";;;
"Salted Caramel Core,Kuhree,2018-12-31,3,Incredibly Sweet,0,1,""I usually get salted caramel core when none of my favorite flavors are available. Even though it's a last resort for me, I still enjoy the sweetness of the vanilla, the chewiness of the blonde brownies, and the incredibly rich caramel. It blend together perfectly.""";;;
"Salted Caramel Core,Willcgo2012,2020-04-26,2,""Great concept, salty execution"",0,0,""I really love salted caramel and blondes. I think in this pint, though, that the caramel is wayyyyy too overpowering and there are too few blondies to enjoy. I ate around the caramel, but as the core spread through the rest, it ruined the ice cream in my opinion.""";;;
Salted Caramel Core,Anonymous person,2019-10-29,3,Not enough Caramel or brownies,0,0,I think it should be a little more brownies and Carmel all the way to the bottom so you can have a little bit of caramels and brownie with each bite after a few scoops mine didn’t have any more brownies like it was only brownies in the top layer of ice cream;;;
Salted Caramel Core,Ericb95,2019-01-25,2,Lack of caramel,0,1,I bought this for the first time tonight 1/23/19 and was super excited because I love salted caramel ice cream. Upon opening the product I noticed that the ice cream had no caramel in it whatsoever. Highly disappointed especially for the price of a pint.;;;
"Salted Caramel Core,SlimDaddy,2017-06-15,3,A Caramel Lover's Dream (With A Catch),0,1,""This ice cream is very tasty with the caramel core. However, my core only went halfway through and then stopped. I also wish the chewy bits were a little more flavorful and thicker. Other than being cheated on the core, I really enjoyed this ice cream.""";;;
Salted Caramel Core,Hanna,2019-02-05,5,Best Ice Cream EVER!!,0,1,I have been obsessed with this flavor since the first time i had it! It's all about balancing the sweet cream and the caramel! Too much caramel might be too salty but too much cream might be too sweet. It a balance and extraordinary once you find it!;;;
"Salted Caramel Core,Kaohinani,2019-04-16,5,MY FAVORITE,0,1,""This is one of my favorite ice cream flavors of all time. The caramel is yes, salted! But I personally love the saltier caramel with the sweet creamy ice cream. And the blondie brownies are so YUM! I will be sad if they ever stopped making this one.""";;;
Salted Caramel Core,Jaclyn7,2018-04-21,2,Barely any blonde chunks and core stopped,0,1,I was so excited to try this but I had barely any blond or chuncks in my ice cream and the core stopped half way through!! I thought the core was supposed to to all the way to the bottom. Very upset and this was my first time trying Ben and Jerry’s;;;
"Salted Caramel Core,cdmccune,2019-04-17,5,Best Flavor Ever,0,1,""I love this flavor, it is now my go to! It is the perfect mix of sweet and salty, only sometimes issue is that the core occasionally stops before the end of the carton. It doesn't matter to me though because I still love the brownies in it!""";;;
Salted Caramel Core,Boommm,2019-11-27,5,Love this ice cream flavor,0,0,This is the absolute best flavor!!!! I love how creamy the ice cream is. The brownies are absolutely amazing full of flavor and very soft!! The caramel is super salty and sweet it's SOO GOOD I'm obsessed. Don't ever change the ingredients!!;;;
"Salted Caramel Core,Shane,2017-07-26,4,Salted Caramel,0,1,""As somebody who grew up on Ben & Jerry's I have been spoiled by so many delicious blends.

"Salted Caramel Core,Jan2018,2018-05-12,2,Great flavor but not much of a core,0,1,""Unlike other reviewers, I enjoyed the flavor of the salted caramel. I didn’t find it too overpowering.

Salted Caramel Core,Dominique,2018-12-22,5,Amazing icecream but needs a little more brownie,0,1,I brought this so manny times I love it really but the thing about it is that it needs a little more brownie dough in there and honestly I love the Carmel center but it’s just the brownies that need a little bit more;;;
"Salted Caramel Core,Amanda,2017-05-12,3,Where's the rest of the core??,0,1,""I loved this ice cream when I stared the pint but not even halfway through, the caramel core just stopped! I had to be a bad batch because no way that's how it's supposed to be. Sad because that was my favorite part!""";;;
Salted Caramel Core,Nina,2017-05-08,3,Not enough chunks,0,1,Bought this last night and while the flavor was great there were literally only 5 chunks of blondies throughout the whole pint. I wish there were a lot more as it would have make the eating experience more enjoyable;;;
"Salted Caramel Core,Ice Cream Fanatic,2017-06-26,5,Wonderful ice cream!,0,1,""This is becoming my favorite ice cream, and one that I have come to crave. The only thing that would make it better would be more of the caramel - Ben and Jerry's makes the best caramel in ice cream I've ever had!""";;;

"Netflix & Chill'd,ChrisColby,2020-03-01,5,""So simple, yet so effective."",11,0,""Ben and Jerry's took the peanut butter/chocolate flavor and knocked it out the park yet again. The peanut butter ice cream is great as always, but combined with the pretzel swirls, the flavor is heightened to an amazing degree. A nice little crunch to the pretzels as well for texture. The brownies aren't quite as good as in other flavors but definitely plentiful and still tasty. Put em all together and you get a salty/sweet peanut butter and chocolate combination that just works. A great flavor.""";;;
"Netflix & Chill'd,wormmoons,2020-03-31,5,THIS IS THE BEST ICE CREAM IVE EVER HAD,12,1,""The actual peanut butter ice cream is amazing, the brownie chunks taste like they were just cooked. The pretzel bits are the most amazing thing I have eaten, they are not too salty. They are not crunchy or too soft, evert time I get a bite with the pretzel in it I have to just stop and savor it. So far I have only found these at Target I have shared about eight pints in a couple weeks with my husband. Honestly it's the best ice cream I've ever had.

And another the next... this is my FAVORITE flavor, even better than any I've had from any specialty ice cream parlor. It's the epitome of sweet and salty. The pretzels are almost more like sprinkles of salt with a bit of texture, the fudge brownie is dark and rich enough to break up any monotony. I don't want this to ever go away (even if it's responsible for 90% of my quarentine weight gain) :P""";;;
Netflix & Chill'd,Kkcott,2020-03-31,4,Needs more brownie,4,3,I got the chocolate fudge brownie and yes there is a great amount of brownie but I think the ice cream to brownie ratio should be more brownie less ice cream!;;;

Netflix & Chill'd,TJSmith,2020-06-09,1,Not good.,3,3,The peanut butter ice cream was chalky and salty. The brownies were made with a very bitter chocolate. The pretzels were in a mushy mass and did not look appetizing. This was probably the only B&J ice cream I have not liked.;;;
"Netflix & Chill'd,suzi,2020-06-22,1,""Not very good, sorry"",3,6,""I am a fan of peanut butter cup and cookie dough, and birthday cake. But I think this one is too much.

The flavor of the peanut butter ice cream was not overpowering as I was concerned, but pleasant. I was disturbed by the texture of the ice cream. It felt gritty and the brownie batter swirl had a taste like chocolate, but was the consistency of taffy. Not my favorite flavor.""";;;
"Netflix & Chill'd,dino19,2020-07-10,1,Not my favorite flavor :(,1,1,""I’m eating this now, and it’s getting harder and harder to eat. The pretzel swirls are strangely too salty and the brownie pieces are too mushy. The peanut butter ice cream is okay. The combination of everything together just doesn’t work for me.

"Netflix & Chill'd,RedCoyote,2020-04-29,2,Salt Explosion,2,3,""If you, like a horse, enjoy licking salt... than this is the ice cream for you. I really wish that the brownie parts were bigger and more brownie like. Also the pretzel dough bites are more like bits of playdough when it comes to flavor, and the added saltiness. Good Idea on paper, not so much in taste.""";;;

This icecream is the most perfect balance of flavours ive ever experienced in a BJ pint. It is salty and sweet, but not too sweet as I find many BJ flavors, and not too salty.""";;;
"Netflix & Chill'd,RoyK,2020-04-23,1,Anticlimactic,3,6,""I was excited to buy this flavor but was quickly disappointed. To me the brownies tasted of rye bread, the ice cream was gritty (not in a good way, either). There was flavor of pretzel but I saw no pieces. I will probably go back to Phish Food next time.""";;;
"Netflix & Chill'd,Sydsscoops,2020-05-27,3,Great concept that needs some tweaking in the lab,1,1,""I wanted to love this flavor. What’s not to like? Peanut butter ice cream with pretzel swirls and brownie pieces—should be a hit. It is not. First, the peanut butter ice cream is WAY too salty. I agree some salt is needed to offset what could otherwise be a cloyingly sweet peanut butter flavor, but this kills any semblance of peanut butter flavor and is unnecessary given the pretzel swirls. Second, why pretzel swirls and not pieces or chunks? The swirls are weirdly soft and barely evoke the sense of eating a pretzel. Finally, the brownie chunks were just weird. They are the same ones as in Half Baked, where they work beautifully. Here, I respect the need to bring in a chocolate component with a peanut butter base, that’s a no-brainer. But why not go with fudge chunks or chips? The brownies brought no flavor to this pint and certainly did not help on texture. A slight re-tooling of the flavors and components would probably make this the ice cream dream the description promised.""";;;

"Netflix & Chill'd,Lexi143,2020-07-28,3,It's Okay...,0,0,""This flavor has such a fun name and sounded amazing, so I recently purchased it. It's not bad by any means, but I found myself wishing there was more sweetness and/or chocolate throughout it. I found the peanut butter and pretzel combo made it a bit on the saltier side, and it would have been nice to have some additional sweetness (like a caramel swirl or chocolate ice cream mixed in) to balance it out a bit more.""";;;

As other reviewers said: I enjoy the milk chocolate, lighter, ice cream with chocolate chunks. The """"chips"""" come in little balls and are surprisingly cripsy and chip tasting. I hope they add these as a permanent flavor! The people who don't like it probably also don't like pineapple on pizza ..""";;;
"Netflix & Chill'd,rayelle,2020-05-15,2,Intense,1,1,""The peanut butter flavor was overwhelming to me and the salty pretzel swirl just layered on the intensity. However, i feel if there were more brownies throughout it would balance out. They all seemed to be clumped into the bottom of mine.""";;;

Netflix & Chill'd,TommyG,2020-08-05,3,Interesting blend of flavors,0,0,The Peanut Butter flavor is very good although the fudge seems out of place and rubbery. The salted pretzel is a nice compliment to the PB but the overall blend of flavors reminds me of a PB&J sandwich. OK but not amazing.;;;

"Chip Happens,chelsealovesicecream,2020-05-13,5,BEST flavor EVER,22,8,""During quarantine I was living off of Half Baked...but when I went to the store all that was left was Chip Happens. Having been heartbroken by another brand's """"Milkshake and Fries"""" I reluctantly bought Chip Happens. I am happy to report Ben & Jerry's NAILED this flavor. The lighter chocolate, chocolate chunks and the perfectly CRUNCHY salty potato chip swirl is EXACTLY what every sweet/salty craving is made of. I put on my quarantine mask and went back to the store and bought the 4 pints left. I need another freezer to stock this flavor. Hope it remains a regular flavor because it says """"limited botched edition"""". Break quarantine and RUN to get Chip Happens!""";;;
"Chip Happens,horix,2020-07-12,5,""Please, never get rid of this potato chip flavor!"",10,6,My favorite flavor used to be Late Night Snack because of the amazing innovation of the salty potato chip balls they used in combination with the sweet ice cream. The combo is heavenly. I've been waiting for years for Ben and Jerry's to bring back the potato chip ingredient and lo and behold yesterday at the store I found this flavor. It's even better than I remember late night snack being"; the potato chip swirl provides a perfect salty and sweet combo in almost every bite. Please make this a permanent flavor; or at least release something else that uses this potato chip ingredient because I'll be SO sad if I have to wait years for it to appear again.;
"Chip Happens,,2020-07-26,4,Love this flavor combo!,5,0,""I tried this for the first time a few days ago and the pint is already gone. This is a perfect flavor for someone that likes the sweet and salty combo (e.g. chocolate covered pretzels). The chip pieces add a nice twist to the chocolate, and the texture/consistency is not weird. There are some bites that I feel the chip chunks are a little too big,but overall it is great!""";;;
"Chip Happens,chipalwayshappens,2020-07-21,5,Best B&J's flavor!,4,1,""I am a lover of all things sweet and salty, so when I saw this in my grocery freezer I just knew I had to try it. Ben & Jerry's did NOT disappoint with this flavor! I've searched for and bought this flavor countless times since I first found it a few months back, and I enjoy it a little more each time. The sweet & salty balance in this one is perfect. The only downside I can say is that the consistency of the potato chips are often in botches and not evenly distributed throughout, but that's nothing some scoop controlling can't fix. Please keep this one permanently!""";;;
"Chip Happens,Sierrastdenis,2020-07-19,5,Amazing!,5,5,""I was so excited when I saw this flavor! I am usually picky with different ice cream flavors. Ben and Jerry’s used to have a flavor that was called The Kitchen Sink...I believe, which was vanilla ice cream with chunks of potato chips mixed in! It was my absolute favorite! I was so upset when it was discontinued! When I found this ice cream I was SO EXCITED! I’m hoping this will become a permanent flavor!""";;;
"Chip Happens,Sydsscoops,2020-07-19,5,Should be a permanent flavor,31,7,""This achieved what Late Night Snack could not--it is a FANTASTIC flavor. The chip swirls have the perfect salt content and potato taste. They stay crispy, which is a great complement to the thin crunch of the chocolate chips and that smooth, almost milk chocolate ice cream. THIS SHOULD BE A PERMANENT FLAVOR. IT'S SO GOOD.""";;;
"Chip Happens,MJamz,2020-05-01,4,Chip Chip Hooray!,5,7,""Fresh off the taste test, I'd say this was a great addition to the flavor line-up! It's simple but different enough from the usual B&J's components (although those are great too!). I appreciate that the base is a bit of a lighter, milkier chocolate-- more like in Chocolate Shake It than Fudge Brownie. The potato chip swirl is fantastically crunchy and salty. I'd love a real mish-mosh with a split between chocolate and vanilla (or peanut butter), and BOTH the chip and pretzel swirl (like in Glampfire Trail Mix)... what botch heaven that would be.""";;;
"Chip Happens,JLI7,2020-07-30,5,Blissful Contrast,2,0,""I am not usually the type that likes a lot of mix-in’s in my ice cream, in fact, it would be accurate to call me a plain Jane. However, I just recently happened to go on to your website and saw that this was a new flavor so after a trip to the grocery store......my palette my most pleased. It was such a wonderful combination both with the velvety chocolate ice cream and then the salty crunch of the potato chips!! Well done———-you most definitely nailed it!!!!!""";;;
"Chip Happens,JayIceCream,2020-05-13,3,Bring back Late Night Snack!,5,3,""Can I express how excited I was to see this on the shelves? I was beyond excited since I was a HUGE fan of Late Night Snack. Upon opening the lid, I noticed chocolate ice cream with giant chunks of chocolate chips and potato chips.On my first bite, I tasted molasses and then bits of chocolates and potato chips. I wasn't a fan of the strong taste of molasses.. Perhaps I was expecting something similar to the discontinued Late Night Snack. Chips Happen wasn't bad but it wasn't great.""";;;
"Chip Happens,LAloveschips,2020-08-08,5,Please keep this as a permanent flavor!!,0,0,""Simple and delicious flavors with great texture! The potato chip stays crispy, and it works great with the size of the chocolate chips. If I were to change anything, I’d add some more potato chip swirls. Maybe even keep the potato chip swirls but then include chocolate covered potato chips instead of the chocolate chips? I really hope this isn’t a fleeting “limited botch”""";;;

"Chip Happens,cmitch927,2020-07-23,5,Make Chip Happens Permanent!,1,0,""When I first came upon this early June I tried the pint and within 5 minutes it was gone. The rich, velvety milk chocolate ice cream blends well with the contrasting textures of chocolate chunks and salty potato chips. I find a reason to drive 10 minutes 3 times a week just to stock up on this flavor exclusively. I am willing to lead the charge to make this flavor permanent. It's genius! I was disappointed that imy local store had sold out. I hope you consider this as a Fan Favorite!""";;;

Far superior to their earlier 'Netflix and Chilled' option I certainly hope this 'limited botch' ice-cream becomesa mainstay as it is delicious and perhaps the best ice-cream that B&J has in Australia atm!""";;;
"Chip Happens,HBunny,2020-05-07,2,Had such potential,6,3,""I was so excited to find this special pint - unfortunately, mine barely had the potato chip swirl I was looking forward to! Ben and Jerry’s are known for their ample mix ins, and this didn’t make the cut. Really bummed!""";;;

But then I was convinced by my sister to try it, whether I like it or not, at least I will actually know how I feel. And oh boy, was I delighted!!! It's truly beautiful creation..!!! It tasted like eating potato chips and drinking chocolate shake at the same time (it doesn't sound weird anymore.) The potato chip swirls are, in fact, CRUNCHY, and salty! So yummy! I am happy that I decided to give this flavor a chance.""";;;

Overall it takes like dipping fries into a Wendy’s Frosty. The chocolate flavor is AMAZING! However, I wasn’t a big fan of the chip “swirls”. It’s soft and doughy, but salty like a chip. The texture threw me off, and reminded me of salt dough. I wasn’t able to enjoy it. If they made just the chocolate flavor separately I would definitely buy it! Tastes just like a frosty.""";;;

NAILED IT!""";;;
Chip Happens,Faye,2020-07-19,3,Make this flavor permanent!!!!!,2,2,Cherry Garcia used to be my favorite. I cannot get enough of Chip Happens. Please make this flavor a regular and not a limited addition. It will bring happiness across the world.;;;

"Chip Happens,marvelouscara,2020-07-06,5,Amazing chocolate CHIPs!,1,5,""I have always been a huge fan of chocolate covered potato chips, so when I saw Ben and Jerry’s had come out with a flavor including both of these flavors, I had to try it. I do not know how they did it, but getting the chips into the ice cream without the chips becoming soggy is a dream come true, and absolute magic as far as I’m concerned. I have found my favorite ever ice cream. Thank you!""";;;
"Chip Happens,BP13,2020-08-20,5,Perfect Mix of Sweet and Salty,0,0,""This flavor is freaking amazing! After falling in love with another limited batch flavor, I told myself I wouldn't try any others in case they disappear forever. Well when I saw Chip Happens at the grocery store I couldn't resist... and have bought a dozen pints since! The chocolate flavor is rich but somehow still light, the chocolate chunks add to the sweetness perfectly, and the chip crumbles are heavenly. 5 stars.""";;;

Cannoli,Doglover88888888,2020-08-12,5,OMG!!!!!! SOOOOOOO DELICIOUS!!!!!,12,1,Am trying this flavor for the first time right now. Took my first bite and fell in love IMMEDIATELY!! May just be my new favorite flavor!! Have tried a different brand of mascarpone ice cream before and it basically just tasted like vanilla. This is the complete opposite!! Definitely not just plain old boring vanilla!! Can NOT believe how amazingly delicious this is!! Everyone needs to try this now!! Would probably drive 10 hours to get this if i had to like omg it's just that good!!!!!!!!!! Please ben and jerry's-I'm literally begging you to keep this flavor FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;;;
"Cannoli,Plumber,2020-08-18,5,LOVE THE SWIRL,1,1,""I love this flavor. It’s light but packs a POWERFUL flavor punch. And the swirl is kind of hidden by its color but man if you find a big pocket of it and try and isolate it, it’s the BEST. The chocolate covered pastry things have Always been crunchy in my 20+ pints to date. The flavor is just so boom in your face. The texture of the Mars alone swirl is insane. This is my 2nd favorite flavor behind Gimme Smore. So help me god if you guys discontinue this flavor or gimme smore, I will come down on you with the wrath of a thousand lightning bolts. Haha. Plz make a cake batter with chocolate chocolate chip swirl and a brownie batter something""";;;
"Cannoli,Arubaman68,2020-03-29,5,My Prayers Have Been Answered!!,4,1,""I was devastated when the “Holly Cannoli” flavor was discontinued years ago. Every time I passed the ice cream aisle in my supermarket, I’d search for the Cannoli flavor, hoping to see it again. Just when I was about to give up, THERE IT WAS!!!!! I scooped up every pint I could get my hands on. This flavor is the best!! The sweet marscapone cream and chocolatey shell pieces make for a sweet celebration for the tastebuds. Thank you so much for bringing this awesome flavor back! Please don’t ever discontinue it again. You’ve struck gold with this flavor — it is truly is a treat!""";;;
"Cannoli,antaresoceana,2020-06-14,5,I think this is my new 2nd favourite ice cream,6,1,""Oh man. Where to begin. Two bites and I knew. The marscapone ice cream? Dude. The cannoli shells? DUDE. They're so crispy it's almost like magic how crispy they stay. And coated in chocolate nonetheless! The marscapone swirl is something you almost forget about too but like not even in a bad way because you end up stumbling upon it without expecting to do so and it HITS YOU IN THE FACE WITH DECADENT FLAOUR. Also the chocolate chips are the mini's, the cute ones. Perfectly sized!! B & J knocked it out of the park with this one. A+++""";;;
Cannoli,Christine94,2020-02-10,5,SO HAPPY IT IS BACK,16,2,Please keep this around forever! For over 7 years I have hoped that this day would come where my favorite dessert ever would return! Such a delicious ice cream!;;;
"Cannoli,Kalidoscope,2020-04-06,4,Not half bad,1,0,""The icecream itself is luxuriously fatty, so it does take some time to eat this as compared to opposing flavors. The mascarpone swirls is what I'd say takes the cake for me, though be aware that not all the chocolate-covered cannoli pieces will be as crisp as you'd expect them to be.""";;;

"Cannoli,Soni,2020-02-10,5,Thank you for making my dreams come true!,5,1,""I have been craving, whining about, and reminiscing about this flavor for YEARS.""";;;
"Cannoli,Scabicky,2020-09-23,1,Cannoli? I don’t think so,0,0,""Not only does this ice cream do nothing to remind you of a cannoli it does not taste good at all. The container says A fan favorite.Overly sweet with an unpleasant aftertaste. Took two bites and tossed the rest. A total misfire. Clearly those fans have never tasted a real cannoli or one of B&J’s better flavors,""";;;
"Cannoli,Fallerina,2020-04-30,2,Where’s the shell pieces?!,1,0,""The flavor is great, but there were almost no pieces of the cannoli shell in the pint. My husband and I both thought it was strange, and maybe a bad batch because you can always count on the pints to be pretty full of all the good stuff listed in the description. But not this time. And I see from another review that maybe this isn’t a fluke after all. The cannoli shell is the best part of the dessert, so it shouldn’t be skimped.""";;;
"Cannoli,ChrisColby,2020-02-26,5,Hopefully never discontinued again!,3,2,""A delicious take on the classic Italian dessert, B&J's Cannoli is a winner. The base is described as a marscapone flavor. Now marscapone isn't typically used for Cannolis but instead ricotta. Marscapone is a cream cheese used for cakes and other desserts. While not quite fitting the theme of a Cannoli in that regard, B&J made the right choice for the sake of flavor. The base is absolutely like a heightened cheesecake. Almost as if their regular cheesecake flavor was mixed with the equally delicious buttery brown sugar one. It's fantastic. The swirl is the same flavor, so they blend together seamlessly for a full on sweet cream cheese taste. And the pastry pieces are the perfect contrast to the base. Crunchy and covered in chocolate, they remind me of the similar chocolate dipped waffle cone pieces from Americone Dream, and there are plenty in each pint.

"Cannoli,RealIceCreamLover,2020-05-07,2,Doesn't taste like a cannoli.,1,0,""First of all traditional cannoli are made with ricotta, not mascarpone. This tastes more like tiramisu without the coffee. It's missing the liquor flavor of a cannoli and was too cheesy. It would be better if it had chocolate shavings, but the base is wrong. I ate it, but I would not it buy again.""";;;

I made all my friends go out and try it and we're all addicted. I have three pints a week. I wish I was joking. We single handedly bought all of the Gimme S'more stock in our grocery store. The day this flavor is retired is the day my happiness dies. :);;;
"Gimme S'more!,Chicksluvrock,2018-09-06,5,Smart way to make a Smore's flavor,20,0,""I have several favorite B&J's flavors, but I decided to go outside of my usual and get this flavor. With the first bite you can definitely taste a hint of marshmallow-y flavor in the base ice cream. It's different than just plain vanilla. I think they did a great job capturing that flavor. The chocolate cookie swirl and graham swirl is smart and I think it's a unique way to add the classic flavor of a smore. And of course, you can't go wrong with fudge flakes! I am a total mix-in and swirl junkie, the more the better, and Ben & Jerry's never disappoints with that! Great job on this flavor! Overall a unique take on a novel summer treat!""";;;
"Gimme S'more!,KGibby,2019-08-21,5,Way better than the OG S'mores!,42,6,""I've had many pints of the Gimme S'more while it's been out and tonight I accidentally grabbed the original S'mores, with the chocolate ice cream. It was the most disappointing moment when I opened the pint to find chocolate ice cream instead of the typical golden ice cream I was used to with the Gimme S'more. Gimme S'more is the perfect representation of what a S'more is: mostly composed of perfectly toasted marshmallows, hint of chocolate, and a great trail of graham crackers. I will be so sad when this pint leaves the shelves. And I will never make the mistake of buying the OG S'mores pint again. Too much chocolate to represent a S'more.""";;;
"Gimme S'more!,HarleyQuinn,2018-04-25,5,My New Favorite,17,3,""I recently had the pleasure of taking a tour of Ben & Jerry's in VT and this was the flavor sample of the day. Instantly, I was hooked. I've been buying some from my local CT grocery store since. There was a sale one night and the store was out. I sat on the floor and cried. While the ice cream base may not taste exactly like marshmallows, is delicious. Everything about this flavor is amazing!""";;;

Gimme S'more is my all time favorite flavor and I've tried almost all the Ben & Jerry's flavors. It is like heaven in your mouth. The graham cracker swirl and chocolate cookie swirl are my two favorite things about this ice cream. Since the flavor is slowly leaving, my friends and I have gone to multiple stores to stock up on what is left. As you can tell we LOVE Gimme S'more and if you're a s'mores lover like me then it's worth the try!""";;;
"Gimme S'more!,Phish Food Fan,2018-10-30,5,""Breathe, it’s gonna be ok."",13,1,""This is such a great new pint! I stocked up and my freezer is loaded with them. The ice cream, the swirls and chunks are so so yummy! If I could eat it every night, I would. This is a LIMITED BATCH! It did not replace S’mores. It’s still available in stores and online. Gimme S’more has come and will go again and regular S’mores will remain. The very first S’mores was retired but the one we’ve been enjoying for quite a while now is still there. So enjoy this for what it is and have your regular S’mores too.""";;;
"Gimme S'more!,VJ101,2018-04-03,5,New Favorite Flavor,21,5,""This is so delicious! It tastes like an amped up cookies and cream but with a graham cracker taste. A S'more is like a cookie so I'm not complaining. I also like it better than the Original. This is my new favorite flavor! I don't think the base tastes like regular vanilla at all. It may not be marshmallow-y, but it's definitely a """"warm, dark"""" and border-lining a faint molasses flavor versus a sweet, strong vanilla if that makes sense. This is my new addiction. I think newbie Ben and Jerry's consumers will take a liking to this one.""";;;
"Gimme S'more!,tyler321321321,2020-06-09,1,A worse version of the old one,27,56,""I was having trouble finding my favorite flavor of B&J at the store, when I came accross this one that seemed to be an overhauled version of it. I bought it and took it home only to discover that it tastes nothing like smores. The chocolate cookies are good but have a really out of place flavor. They definitely should have had a soft fudge swirl or something instead. The graham crackers are the best part, but there just weren't enough. And the ice cream which says its """"toasted marshmallow"""" flavor just tastes like vanilla. Overall very disappointing not just as a replacement for the old smores but for ben and jerry's in general. I really did not like this one.""";;;
"Gimme S'more!,ChrisColby,2018-04-28,4,""Not quite S'mores, but tasty nonetheless."",4,5,""The new S'mores flavor is much better than the standard flavor from the company. Ben and Jerry's wisely made the decision to use a marshmallow base instead of chocolate, so it doesn't overpower the other components. The base tastes more like sweet cream than marshmallow but when combined with the fudge flakes and graham cracker, the result tastes very close to the real deal. My only complaints are that the chocolate cookie crumbs overpower what little graham cracker there is, losing the theme a little. And the fudge flakes are strangely limited. Still, the components all come together to provide a tasty flavor, and I hope this limited edition lasts as long as possible.""";;;
"Gimme S'more!,Gimmemoresmore,2018-06-25,5,Best EVER,11,3,""Honestly, I don't love ice cream. It's my least favorite dessert. But, about once a year I get a craving. I saw the Gimme S'more ice cream in the store and love s'mores so thought I'd give it a shot. Total game changer. This is the best ice cream I've ever had and I've ended up buying it like 7 times. I'm so sad it's limited edition and hope it becomes permanent. It's perfectly simple and complex-I wouldn't change a thing. I'm reviewing in hopes marketing people see its ratings and decide to keep it!!""";;;

"Gimme S'more!,Bip407,2018-08-21,2,Prefer original S’mores flavor,3,4,""I feel like this is a just a sweet vanilla ice cream with a cookie swirl, like cookies and cream. There was no noticeable marshmallow flavor, and occasionally I could taste the graham cracker. I much prefer the chocolate based s’mores flavor which was rich chocolate, and a creamy marshmallow, with the perfect amount of crumbly graham cracker. Really, what do you remember about s’mores over the campfire? The melted Hershey chocolate and the gooey toasted marshmallow, followed by the crumbly graham cracker. This new flavor really doesn’t have any of that except the memory of the gritty graham cracker, which was really only there to hold onto the chocolate and marshmallow.""";;;
"Gimme S'more!,nflamari9488,2018-03-29,5,""All I kept thinking was """"oh man, oh man!"""""",14,4,""I literally just bought this 20 minutes ago, put a little bit in a bowl, and decided I had to write the review. I agree with one reviewer where they said the marshmallow ice-cream doesn't really taste like marshmallow. However, I feel like that's a really difficult flavor to capture and the overall execution was very good. I totally tasted the graham cracker pieces and I LOVE the chocolate cookies BJ puts in their ice-cream. If I had to make a critique or suggestion, I would say maybe have more graham cracker swirls and/or flavor the ice-cream graham cracker and have marshmallow swirls with the cookie and graham crackers? I don't know though because I'm pretty overkill with my ice-cream. If it doesn't sound like I'm going to die it wouldn't be my first choice. All in all, I am so happy, I'm struggling to not get more, and I would be very sad if this never came back.""";;;

I noticed one love came back again this year so ive been waiting to see this one too especially since I can't imagine a single person who tried this didn't love it. I saw one person in their review said they ate 3 pints a week. I ate a whole pint every single day the whole time it was available. Bought my grocery store out every time they restocked. I still have 3 or 4 a week but no other flavor compares to this one, not even my old favorite. This ice cream ruins all other ice creams.""";;;
"Gimme S'more!,Jenn01234,2020-02-26,1,I have never been let down more,3,0,""The original s'mores ice cream was a dream come true, it was by far my favorite Ben & Jerry's flavor and I even drove to Vermont to tour the facility and get a cone there. When I tried this replacement I had hope to be wowed but was left feeling nothing but disappointment. S'mores do not have cookies in them so I am not sure where that idea came from, and normally I would like cookies in my ice cream but if I am looking for the flavor profile of a s'more this ice cream just doesn't deliver.""";;;
"Gimme S'more!,Bkeller08,2018-04-15,1,Why change a good thing?,10,9,""My favorite flavor of Ben and Jerry’s is S’mores, which I have been a fan of since it was called Marsha Marsha Marshmallow but it is the HARDEST flavor to find! I saw Gimme S’more in my grocery and got so excited! But when I got home, I was disappointed. I thought my favorite part of S’mores was the graham cracker swirls which are also in this flavor, but it turns out, the Chocolate ice cream was more vital to the awesomeness of the flavor than I thought. The “toasted marshmallow” Ice cream just tastes like vanilla. While the add-ins are good, the ice cream part of this pint leaves something to be desired. I guess I’ll forever be on the hunt for my fave flavor “S’mores” because you can’t beat it! They shouldn’t have changed a good thing!""";;;
"Gimme S'more!,Savv,2019-07-24,5,PLEASE BRING IT BACK,0,0,""I need this flavor to return. This was my favorite flavor of ice cream ever and I would buy multiple pints of it out of fear that I would go to the store one day and the “limited batch” ice cream would be gone. My heart broke as I checked the Ben and Jerry’s section of the freezer and saw that there was no more and it wasn’t coming back. PLEASE bring this back even for just a month so I can buy every stores stock. I’m serious, every time I eat ice cream now I just feel like it isn’t the same as gimme s’mores.

But I'm docking it one star because it comes nowhere close to the original S'mores flavor--this strikes me as a disappointing remix. The ice cream itself tastes closer to sweet cream than toasted marshmallow, and it lacks enough chocolate to actually compare it to a s'more--chocolate is supposed to be a constant component of the dessert! While I prefer the original's chocolate base regardless";" if this flavor had more chocolate chunks and a toasted marshmallow swirl like the original, it might be a lot better. But as it stands, OG S'mores is still my favorite ice cream flavor ever and this simply doesn't come anywhere close to it.""";;

I was so disappointment when the ice cream flavor was changed to chocolate. That being said, once they brought back the toasted marshmallow flavored ice cream, I was thrilled. I liked the chocolate cookies, but the ice cream felt more like cookies and cream than s’mores, so I just added my own crushed graham crackers. EVEN MORE RECENTLY I noticed they changed the recipe, again. This time it was perfected!! I no longer have to add my own graham crackers.""";;;
Gimme S'more!,Lare Bear,2019-06-12,3,A solid pint. Great use of flavor choice.,0,0,I bought this flavor last week while making a trip to my local scoop shop. Let me just start out by saying that smores is a hard flavor to really nail flavor wise. I really enjoyed the marshmallow ice cream. Alot of companies usually go with chocolate as a base for Smores and I think that its usually overwhelming and distracting from the marshmallow. So the star of the flavor show was definitely on point. The grahms are great and are a great topping used in alot of flavors lately. Unfortunately tgis pint suffers from the same thing most smores flavored things do and it was ultimately too sweet in my opinion. I enjoyed this pint but theres too many more to try to stop here!;;;
"Gimme S'more!,Cassidy,2018-04-13,1,Definitely missed the mark,12,7,""S’mores is my favorite flavor EVER. So when I saw Gimme S’mores in my local grocery store I almost fell over I was so excited! However the excitement was short-lived because this is not s’mores. Not even the slightest bit. If I were blindfolded and tried this, I would never guess that it is s’mores flavor. The “marshmallow” ice cream is vanilla and there is no hint of graham cracker. The most overpowering part is the chocolate cookie swirl...which is not s’mores. Don’t get me wrong, the ice cream is good! If I were rating based on taste it would get 5 Stars. But I’m rating it based on how closely it captures the s’mores flavor. If I could give it a 0 I would because this is basically The Tonight Dough without the cookie dough and chocolate ice cream. So do yourself a favor and just get that because at least you have cookie dough.""";;;

Alas, the day finally encroached upon my innocent self that I would see in its stead, """"One Love"""".

Being summer and seeing the store did not have any of my favorites, I thought I would try this """"new"""" flavor. I have to say, it is not at all what I was hoping for. I am a marshmallow junkie and was hoping for toasted marshmallow flavor";" instead, I felt like I was eating vanilla chocolate chip with some of those cake crunchies that you find in ice cream cakes. I will go back to my regular flavors or skip buying if Gimme S'more is my only other option.""";;
"Gimme S'more!,ash84,2018-10-07,5,The real deal!,1,0,""I have been a hard-core regular cookie dough ice cream only fan for YEARS, but this flavor caught my eye at the beginning of summer and I haven't been able to buy any other ice cream since! It's the amazing cookie swirl that almost convinced me that I could love the Tonight Dough flavor, despite my hatred for the nasty peanut butter dough. And the ever so creamy toasted marshmellow ice cream was a pleasant surprise! Even the graham cracker swirl blends in perfectly so you don't feel like you have random dry crumbs messing up the texture! It's the perfect combination that at times tastes like what an Oreo ice cream should taste like! I haven't had my go-to cookie dough ice cream in over 4 months and will be incredibly sad when this masterpiece goes away!""";;;
"Gimme S'more!,moorejennie78,2018-07-15,1,The original S'mores is better,8,3,""This flavor does not remind me of S'mores at all. Why cookies? The chocolate flakes are more like big pieces... too big for this. I couldn't even finish the container. It wasn't worth it. first time I've done that with Ben & Jerry's. Hopefully you'll never quit making the original S'mores, even if they are only in the shops.""";;;
Gimme S'more!,,2020-06-24,5,Best ice cream I’ve ever had in my life,0,0,I had an ad pop up on my Instagram timeline for this ice cream and I went and found it at my local H-E-B. The next day I went back and they were out. I went to 4 Walmart’s and 3 more H-E-B’s with no luck until I finally found it at target. I have now bought all the pints from my local target.

I was expecting more of a s’mores flavor, and I would explain this ice cream as more of a “marshmallow cookie crunch.” It’s still good! Just not s’mores. It would be better with gooey marshmallows :)""";;;
"Gimme S'more!,OTstudent90,2018-04-09,1,A miss unfortunately,7,4,""I just bought this as well as my staple, cookie dough. Cookie dough was as usual amazing but this one was just a miss for me. It reminded me of the pint slices, not nearly enough toppings or pieces. It was mostly vanilla ice cream with some cookie pieces in it. Definitely not enough marshmallows to make it feel like a s'mores ice cream. Anyway, I love most of B&Js flavors but this one wasn't for me""";;;
"Gimme S'more!,Frog,2018-05-31,5,Breaks my Heart this is Only Limited Batch,3,1,""I like ice cream and I eat a fair amount of it but never have I had an ice cream that haunts my dreams like this one. This ice cream might actually be perfect. The toasted marshmallow base is excellent and not too sweet and the flakes of chocolate add the perfect crunch to the blend. I'm not a big chocolate ice cream fan and I think that making the base marshmallow allows all of the flavors to be appreciated as one instead of being overpowered by chocolate. However, by far my favorite part of this ice cream is the graham cracker fudge swirl. Holy moley! It has a fantastic texture and the taste leads me on a whirlwind adventure. I don't know what I have to do to make this more than just a limited batch but I will do it. Every time I go to the grocery store I hold my breath that it will still be there waiting for me, cool and delicious.""";;;
"Gimme S'more!,Givemesmoreforever,2018-04-24,5,Tastes so good it should be illegal,4,3,""This is my new favorite ice cream. While I agree that the base ice cream is not an exact replica of marshmallows, it does not taste like plain vanilla... more like the melted gooey inside of a marshmallow that’s not actually warm or gooey. The add ins are perfection to me between the swirls graham and chocolate cookie I’m in ice cream heaven. I have to carefully calculate my purchases so this is the only cheat on my diet each week! I hope it goes from “limited batch” to “here to stay”!""";;;

The cookies and graham crackers are amazing in it. I literally went through the process of giving my info just so I could write this review in hopes that the flavor is continued and more people improve upon their lives by buying this flavor.;;;

When I went to the store and didn't see the other one anymore (which btw was my favorite flavor ever!) and saw this one I decided to give it a try, but overall I was very disappointed. The ice cream itself is not good and the chocolate cookies do not taste like s'mores to me. Please bring the old one back!!!""";;;
Gimme S'more!,KerryB88,2018-04-10,2,Overall NOT S'mores!,5,3,It's vanilla ice cream not toasted marshmallow. That alone was extremely disappointing. A little graham cracker swirl was ok.

There needs to be a smoky element, whether that be smoked salt or bits of charred marshmallow. Also there needs to be a LOT more graham. I couldn't taste it at all.

I eat my Ben and Jerry’s with one of my son’s toddler spoons to help make the pint last longer (as I always eat the whole thing) but this one I couldn’t help but take huge bites anyway.

No, But it was good enough to wear I would purchase again if I needed something different in my life. It does get better. Do not give up on this flavor, you really just gotta commit. Not a total fail of the s'mores flavor, which tends to be a difficult one to portray, however not a total success. It is good, though maybe not a typical s'mores.

What a disappointment! I literally took one bite and made a face because I did not like the flavor. I dug around for a minute looking for a marshmallow swirl.... nope, it's not there. Just small bits of chocolate cookie. What? How is this a smores ice cream? The base ice cream tastes nothing like marshmallow and certainly doesn't have the wonderful marshmallow texture the old ice cream had. Couldn't find anything resembling graham cracker here either, unlike the old one. This is just.... cookies and cream. And a pretty dull cookies and cream at that. This is not only nothing like smores, it is a dull ice cream.""";;;

"Peanut Butter Half Baked,ChrisColby,2020-02-26,5,Peanut Butter makes everything better,10,1,""A flavor I'm glad to see back after liking it before it was discontinued, PB Half Baked is even better than I remembered. There's not much to say if youve already had the standard half baked. It works very similarly except that the vanilla portion of the flavor is now replaced with peanut butter ice cream, and the chocolate chip cookie dough is instead peanut butter cookie dough. For such slight changes though, they do make a big difference. One thing I disliked in the original half baked was how weak the vanilla base was and how it was completely dominated by the chocolate. That's not the case here as the peanut butter taste to the ice cream is strong enough to balance out the chocolate, giving the classic combination we know and love. The balance is also matched perfectly with the mix ins. There are HUGE brownie squares in this flavor, tasting great as always, and combined with the numerous peanut butter cookie dough pieces, you're getting the chocolate/peanut butter taste in every bite. If you're a fan of that flavor combination, you can't go wrong with Peanut Butter Half Baked.""";;;
Peanut Butter Half Baked,Nicoledobermanmom,2020-04-07,5,Best flavor EVER,2,0,Normally the tonight dough is my go to. I have been waiting for this flavor to get to my area and went it finally did I made sure run right to the store. I was in LOVE after the first bite .

"Berry Sweet Mascarpone,JennyWoof,2020-04-24,5,Berry good!,19,1,""All time favorite flavor! The berry flavored swirls of ice cream are perfectly delicately, but distinctly, flavored. The natural pastel purple that comes from the blackberries is definitely an adorable plus! The mascarpone ice cream swirls have that heavenly cheesecake-y taste, which combines with the soft crumbly shortbread to create a tiramisu-esque experience... but instead of the rich notes coming from cinnamon it comes from the crunchy fudge-covered almonds. May I suggest renaming this flavor to """"Chuck Berry Mascarpone"""" after Chuck Berry: one of the pioneers of rock'n'roll.""";;;
"Berry Sweet Mascarpone,Lexi143,2020-07-30,5,Seriously The Best Ice Cream Ever,3,0,""This is without a doubt the best ice cream I have ever tried from Ben and Jerry's, and probably from anywhere at all! There is a B&J's scoop shop down the street from my apartment, one a couple miles away, and countless grocery stores in between. However, I constantly find myself driving out of the way to go to the only store in the area that I know stocks this flavor regularly. It is the perfect combination of flavors, and I have a really hard time keeping myself from going through the whole pint in one quick sitting. I will be absolutely devastated when this exclusive flavor is no longer available. Please keep it as a regular!!""";;;

I thought it was going to be gross but I was pleasantly surprised by how all the flavors complimented each other. I left a few other people in the house have a small spoonful and they liked it as well. And to the person who said Strawberry Cheesecake is gone, you are wrong. That flavor is everywhere and never going away. Perhaps your store just stopped carrying it. It would be nice if they brought back the Blueberry Cheesecake flavor that was an exclusive at Walmart years ago. Anyway, Blackberry ice cream gets thumbs up from me!""";;;
Berry Sweet Mascarpone,JEM2021,2020-08-09,5,Love this!,1,0,This is my new favorite ice cream!!! It is absolutely delicious! I saw this at my local Whole Foods and decided to give it a try since I was craving ice cream with berries and I was so pleased when I got home and tried it. This flavor has just the right amount of sweetness and the flavor combo is to die for. The chocolate covered almonds and cookie bits not only add to the flavors but provide a great texture. I usually don't write reviews but this is so good and I'm afraid it will only be a limited time product. I hope they keep this one. I'll buy it forever. Recommending to all my family and friends.;;;

Justice ReMix'd,Puppylove,2019-12-14,5,Best Flavor! Please Add Permanently!’,20,1,I have been hooked on half baked for years now but this flavor changed everything! There’s just so much depth of flavor. I thought the spicy brownie would be too much but it’s very mild. I’d still prefer normal brownie but not by much. I love that the cinnamon ice cream and chocolate ice cream are two different ice creams swirled together. At first glance I thought it was going to be just chocolate ice cream with cinnamon flavor but I was wrong. Every bite is a unique balance of flavor that sends my tastebuds to heaven. I just wish it wasn’t a limited batch. I can’t go back to just half baked after this.;;;
"Justice ReMix'd,VanessaB99,2019-09-23,5,Keep this flavor! PLEASE!!!,28,0,""I bought this flavor today. Upon trying it, I immediately wanted to go back to the store & buy every pint that they had.

I'm getting emotional thinking about this ice cream. I tell everyone I know to please try this ice cream. I sent out text messages to my family telling them to go buy this ice cream. I have never tasted anything like it in my life! Please keep it forever! I'm obsessed! (And of course I am also happy to hear about the nonprofit partnership.)""";;;

"Justice ReMix'd,Jackson,2019-10-01,5,Possibly your greatest flavor ever.,17,1,""This hit every sweet spot for me. I'm serious. Absolutley loved this flavor, and I'm actually a little sad I tried it, because if it's a limited edition flavor that means it'll go away and never return. This needs a spot in the regular rotation. Don't make me go back to the store and hoard all of them.""";;;
"Justice ReMix'd,CinnamonLover,2020-02-02,5,Best Ice Cream so far!,3,0,""I love cinnamon more than any other flavour in general (in cakes, bubble gum, tequilla, porridge ... - you see, ice cream is certainly no exception), so i was really excited to try the ben & jerry's cinnamon bun, when I saw that flavour for the first time some years ago. Unfortunately, when it comes to ice cream, I strongly prefer chocolate over vanilla or caramel as a base, so I the cinnamon bun flavour didn't blow my mind completelly. Just 1 hour ago I saw THIS new flavour at a gas station and coudn't resist. It's even better than I expected, because the spiciness harmonize so well with the cinnamon & chocolate (that I always love). So I highly recommend this ice cream flavour to anyone, who really loves cinnamon in general and chocolate ice cream.""";;;
"Justice ReMix'd,SciFiLover,2019-11-25,5,The spicy fudge MWAH!,2,0,""The Ben & Jerry's line of ice cream is some of the best I have ever tasted. When I spied this, the newest in the freezer at my local grocery I was intrigued. So I ponied up my cash and brought it home. As usual, I popped the top and took a taste. OMG! I was floored. This has to be added to the line-up as a permanent option.It is everything I did not expect it to be. The flavors burst in your mouth! The combination of cinnamon and chocolate, although seemingly odd, are perfect together. And the """"topping on the cake"""" is the spicy fudge brownie. Love this new flavor.""";;;

The balance of cinnamon ice cream, chocolate ice cream, tiny chunks of cinnamon bun dough, and bits of spicy brownie?! OH MY GOD. It's perfect. I saw a picture of this flavor online and then noticed it in my local grocery store, so I bought it. That was a month ago and now I can't stop. Please please please, Mr. Ben and Mr. Jerry I am begging you from my soul to keep this in the permanent rotation. JUSTICE TASTES DELICIOUS.""";;;

"Justice ReMix'd,Jcforever3,2020-01-22,4,Pretty good flavor! Worth trying.,2,0,""I saw this in the store and had to buy it as soon as I saw the words """"spicy brownie."""" They weren't lying, the brownies have a really interesting kick! I can understand why it was too strong for some, but for me it made up for the lack of cinnamon promised in the ice cream and cinnamon bun dough (which basically was like their cookie dough in texture minus the chips). This is a flavor for people who like the classics but are bold enough to try out some more exotic ones. Overall, one of the most intriguing flavors I've had from Ben and Jerry's.""";;;
"Justice ReMix'd,ForTheLoveOfReMixd,2020-01-27,5,If This is Discontinued....,4,0,""I'm not sure I will ever love again! This is a fantasticly unusual combination that just hits every mark for me. I can usually ration out my pints over a couple weeks, but this flavor only lasts me two sittings! Anytime you need a break from the sugary cinnamon, the deep rich chocolate is there to smooth things over with a little spice and vice versa. I would definitely become a regular fanatic if this became a daily flavor (r.i.p. my diet)""";;;
"Justice ReMix'd,Adam,2020-01-31,5,I LOVE this flavor,3,0,""It's so good! The cinnamon seems to pervade the entire pint and the spicy brownie bits are so tasty and interesting! I don't think that Ben and Jerry's has another flavor with a spicy element and I don't think that they need another one if they were to just keep this one around, which is exactly what they should do! I am gonna be so sad when they take this one away. I get that its kind of a weird flavor but it seems like the people who like it, REALLY love it.""";;;

I really do. All the mix-ins were right up my alley. I don't know where my taste buds took a wrong turn.

But the spicy brownie in it overpowers everything. I end up picking it out of the ice cream. Honestly either the brownie needs to be taken out all together or the brownie needs to be a plain brownie instead of a spicy one. There is also so much brownie in it so it could also stand to be toned down in that regard as well;;;
"Justice ReMix'd,IceCreamMan99,2020-06-15,1,Why????,0,0,""I got this flavor by accident. Had done curbside pickup at the grocery, but instead of Phish Food, I received this. It sat in the freezer for about a week and decided to try it. I honestly feel like my taste buds were being punished, as if i lost a bet and was forced to eat this. If fear factor created an ice cream flavor, this would be it. None of the flavors work together. The cinnamon is too strong. Would be better if it tasted more like a cinnamon roll than the cinnamon challenge from a few years back. The spicy brownie makes no sense. The flavor is so off putting, i wanted to gag. They could have easily used some sort of Mexican hot chocolate flavor and it would have been so much better. I really have no words except this is one of the most vile and disgusting flavors I have ever eaten. Save your money and make a donation to your favorite social justice charity.""";;;

Unfortunately for me it was a major flop. The ice cream and fudge cows were enjoyable. The toffee clusters were a weird texture experience, unfortunately. I was expecting something more along the lines of the toffee in Everything But The.... which I really enjoy. The real disappointment, and reason I'm actually taking the time to review ice cream, was the sugar cookie dough core. For me, it just tasted of wet sugar. Grainy, too soft, no flavor. Ben and Jerry's has set high expectations for their products, but sadly this one didn't deliver for me.""";;;

I pe this flavor because it is BY FAR the best tasting Ben and Jerry’s flavor ever made, no competition... and i amd a huge Ben and Jerry’s fan. The reason I hate it is because this flavor has caused me to gain like 30 lbs at this point because I cannot stop eating it. It does not get old. Ever. The crunchy sweetness of the toffee is spot on amd just pairs PERFECTLY with the sugar cookie core and the milk chocolate ice cream. Oh yeah, MILK CHOCOLATE. The milk chocolate is so good. I have eaten probably like 50 of these at this point and everytime the core is big and i never get a bad core. Every pint i have gotten has been just as good ig not better than the last.

I wanted to add a review since there was only one so far... To my surprise the cone was still crispy and the amount of fudge covering the cone was not overwhelming whatsoever. But the caramel swirl is fantastic quality, bringing back memories of the first time I had caramel with a side of Apple. I chose this because I was looking for a non traditional flavor but not too rich, now don't get me wrong, eating half a pint is definitely a hefty load on the gut but it doesn't feel too busy and you still get to enjoy the ice cream.""";;;

Americone Dream,makeupsbymarie,2018-11-19,4,,0,0,I’ve always loved Ben & Jerry’s. I really like this flavor. It’s really sweet and all of these flavors together are amazingly good. The only bad thing about this flavor is that the ice cream cone chunks are soggy. Either than that it’s super good and I recommend! It’s an ice cream that you can get an upset tummy over because it’s not too much chocolate!;;;

Americone Dream,sighrijaa,2020-06-22,5,,0,0,The best combination of things. I like vanilla based things more than chocolate ice cream based things and so I stay away from a lot of Ben and Jerrys flavors because most are the latter. This is great for a vanilla lover.

Whiskey can sometimes overpower all the ingredients--this ice cream has a great balance of flavor and the whiskey is not to overpowering.

It was a great flavor while it lasted though.;;;

"Brewed to Matter,VanessaB99,2020-03-24,2,Unbalanced and disappointing,0,3,""I can see that the inspiration for this flavor came from a fancy coffee drink like a frozen mocha or Frappuccino. However the balance of flavors & textures is off for my taste. There's not enough coffee flavor. The coffee flavor would be improved by using the cold brew method instead of coffee extract. The extract brings an unpleasant aftertaste. The chocolate chunks are too big and dominating. There's not enough brownie swirl and it's not as prominent of """"brownie"""" flavor or texture as in other pints. While this flavor idea is good, I think the execution definitely needs to be adjusted. I still love Ben & Jerry's! I'm just not a fan of this pint.""";;;

Coffee ice cream is my all-time, hands-down favourite type of ice cream that is reliably available. Coffee ice cream with chocolate syrup to be specific. So this pint? It does it all for me man. It does all of the heavy lifting, it unscrews the jar lids that are on too tight, and it even pumps my gas for me when it's raining out. I didn't even need to think about exerting an iota of effort to get the flavour profile of this pint exactly where I wanted it. Didn't even need to turn location services on. A++""";;;

"Brewed to Matter,Icecreamfan4life,2018-06-26,3,Le Sigh...,0,1,""Welp, I finally broke down and bought this flavor that I've often seen mentioned on the site(wasn't quite in my usual buying locales til recently). And figured since a friend of mine told me how awesome she found this flavor or I think another coffee flavor by B&J's to be really great. I figured I would give it a whirl and try it as a """"breakfasty"""" sort of option for a change. I mean it has coffee in it right? Figured it would perk me up a bit more before work. Add in the chocolate and sugar in general, I figured I would be good to go. But unfortunately I was wrong. The coffee flavor wasn't quite as strong(save for on 2/3's of the top of the pint, to the point of me not being able to tell if the fudge pieces were plain fudge flavor or expresso flavored), even appreciated the thinner fudge pieces. But hardly got any of the brownie swirl flavor until I was a 1/4 of the way done with the pint. Not to mention, after consuming a good half of the pint before work, I would have thought I'd have some get up and go(which I tend to get in general off of coffee flavored ice creams). But I had a good 10 to 15 min bit of pep before I crashed and wanted to nap so hard even before I left the house. So in other words, me thinks this flavor is going to be a no can do for me in the future. And would recommend it to folks that like coffee flavored ice creams you can eat at night and still get a good night's rest afterward.""";;;
"Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake,Bridgespo99997,2019-02-02,2,Could be amazing.,8,0,""The cheese cake ice creams could be amazing, but for some reason the one thing wrong with the ice cream is the cheesecake balls. The balls taste very chemical and just not right. Overall I scooped around them. While the carmel flavor really lacked in this ice cream, and the chocolate cookie swirl was very little and almost nonexistent. I am very disappointed with how all of the cheesecake truffles have turned out. Overall, the truffles ruin the ice cream and need to be reformulated. While I am disappointed that this ice cream lacked swirl and Carmel. What could be amazing, was ruined by lack of and truffles.""";;;
"Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake,Tr6nce,2020-05-29,2,Flavor's okay but..,4,0,""The flavors work for the most part. Ben & Jerry's ice creams with the graham cracker swirl are my personal favorites but this one left much to be desired. My main problem are the truffles, in this flavor in particular. The truffles seem to be frozen until you bite into them and then it's soft. I can't really enjoy the truffles if I'm too worried about the cold shock to my gums from parts of the ice cream being unexpectedly frozen in random places. I'm used to thinks like strawberries in the cheesecake to be frozen, but then something like the truffles that should be soft like the cookie dough is frozen, I can't really enjoy it.""";;;
"Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake,kuroyuuki,2018-06-11,3,Like everything but the cheesecake truffles,11,1,""First of all, let me just say that I love this truffle craze that has been going on and made a point to try every option. For this flavor, I love mostly everything about this: the ice cream, the swirls, the exterior of the truffles. However, I do not like the cheesecake interior of the truffles. The cheesecake flavoring is already there through the ice cream, but the cheesecake part of the truffles does not retain the coldness of the ice cream and doesn't fit. I think a chocolate interior would have probably worked better. Would not buy again unless I felt the desire to eat everything but the truffle.""";;;
"Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake,MJamz,2020-04-17,4,Redemption!,1,0,""I feel like this remake of the old cheesecake truffle flavor totally snuck in under the radar--and a shame, because it's such an upgrade! Where the truffles were the downfall of the old version (no offense, Ben & Jerry), the new cheesecake pieces are exactly what I look for in a cheesecake ice cream mix-in. They're not liquidy and greasy like the truffles, but actually have a fluffy chew to them, and they taste great! A couple pieces even had a toasty crust on them. On the downside, the cookie crumble swirls were really thin, but I *almost* didn't even mind, because I came for the cheesecake on this one, and I got it!""";;;
"Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake,TheFeistyTeddyBear,2019-07-03,1,Definitely misses the mark.,4,6,""I bought this tonight for my mom and I. I couldn’t eat it. It’s some of the worst flavored ice cream I have had. The cookie crumbs do taste like cooking crumbs, gritty and all. The caramel flavor is very light barely there. The cheesecake truffle pieces are terrible. I love cheesecake, I bake wonderful cheesecakes, I hate the no bake style of cheesecake but these truffles are worse than that. They taste like someone took ice milk and mixed a dash a cream cheese in it. I was sorely disappointed. My mom did not enjoy it either. I have not idea what I am going to do with the stuff now but I’m certainly not going to eat it.""";;;

"Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake,FuzzyGut,2019-07-03,2,Boring,10,4,""See, here is my issue: if I’m going to spend 1200 calories in one sitting on ice cream (and we all eat the whole pint) after working hard to burn enough calories to eat it, I want to melt at the first bite and feel the euphoria with every spoonful, and SO many Ben and Jerry’s flavors do that for me. But when a flavor is just ok, there is no way I’m going to eat it. There was nothing wrong really, with this flavor but I found the ice cream grainy and the flavor boring, and the truffles just didn’t do it for me. I LOVE Ben and Jerry’s, the pints are my favorite ways to spend my calories but I can’t justify eating a boring one. My wife liked it well enough but she wasn’t wowed either. I remember my first bites of Phish Food, Half Baked, one sweet world and so many others that just made me melt into a pool of euphoric joy and that’s what I need from my pints.""";;;

Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake,Naz815,2019-12-18,5,The only ice cream I will ever eat!!!,0,0,I have tried so many different brands and flavors of ice cream and I can honestly say This is hands down the best ice cream I have ever had in my life! The flavors are so perfect in every way and compliment eachother so well! I dont understand why Walmart & target near me stopped carrying it! I have been craving it so bad and refuse to eat anything else. I really liked cinnamon buns before trying this flavor and they dont sell that anymore either!! PLEASE BRING IT BACK!!!;;;

"Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake,Cat6,2020-01-07,5,The BEST,0,0,""After One Love stopped restocking, I didn’t think it was possible I would find another flavor to top it. But then I tried this. It is the absolute BEST flavor. Everything in it mixes perfectly together, and the cheesecake bites are melt in your mouth amazing. The only complaint I have is it’s been so hard to find anywhere near me. I’ve traveled to outside towns looking for this flavor with no luck. Please restock this is southwest Missouri!!!""";;;
"Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake,There4IM,2019-05-09,2,""Disappointed in """"cheesecake"""""",0,0,""I'm just now dipping into Ben and Jerry's to find a favorite flavor. Based on the package description, I should have loved this. The caramel ice cream was a bit bland and could have been vanilla. The chocolate swirl was nice, and I would have enjoyed even more graham cracker. The """"cheesecake"""" truffles were a real problem for me, tasting mostly of coconut oil. I'm going to continue my sampling, but the cheesecake flavors are out.""";;;
"Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake,Olivia Valeria,2018-06-24,5,I skip all meals for this!,1,1,""Oh my goodness, I'm so hooked on this flavor that I'd rather eat this than dinner. I'm almost glad it goes so fast at the stores near me so I don't eat it so often... The cheesecake truffles in this are delicious and the caramel is not overwhelming, it's subtle but just the perfect combination!""";;;
"Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake,Autumnlv82,2019-10-19,5,Best flavor ever,0,0,""This is the best icecream flavor I've ever had hands down! My husband has bought me atleast 10 pints because I've never had a icecream I love more and now I cant find it anywhere in my town. Makes me so sad. I'm craving it and I need it back in my life. Best flavor ever Ben & Jerry's, please never take this one away & please make it more available. Gilmer Texas to be exact. This is a winner""";;;
Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake,Sam0505,2019-03-17,1,My least favorite flavor I have tried,1,1,The name sounded like something I would love. There was nothing chocolatey or caramelish about it. The cheesecake bites tasted like rotten milk. Not sweet at all. I definitely do not recommend this flavor.;;;
Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake,Limesti,2018-05-10,5,The best flavor ever!!!,1,1,So I eat a couple pints of Ben and Jerry’s per night usually and I have to say that this is probably my favorite flavor! It’s soooo cheesecakey and amazing. Please make this flavor forever :-);;;
Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake,Lizy1917,2020-09-10,5,Best Ice Cream Ever,0,0,I've eaten a lot of ice cream in my time and I've never had a favorite until now. This is the best ice cream i have ever had. The cheesecake bites are actually big sized piece and there aren't too many to over power the ratio. The three flavor just mix so perfectly together. I say if you like cheesecake and caramel you better go try this delicious flavor. BEST ICE CREAM EVER!;;;

"Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake,superpremium,2018-05-06,4,Good!,0,0,""Enjoyed this flavor. Caramel cheesecake ice cream is smooth, extremely tasty, and both flavors are prominent. The cookie swirls are just as awesome as they are in tonight dough. The truffles were good and the cheesecake flavor was good, but the truffles did not add or take away anything. I didn't deem them necessary in this particular pint, but it is still a great flavor.""";;;
Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake,Mandy27,2020-02-07,5,Super good! Buying again!,0,0,I just got this ice cream yesterday and it’s already gone! I really enjoyed the overall flavors. Very creamy and not over powering. It didn’t give me any gas problems(lactose intolerant). The only downer about the ice cream was the little white balls of cheesecake( wish it was a little sweet) but overall super good ice cream. I think it’ll be one of my favorites!;;;
Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake,Coyoterose,2018-11-19,1,Cheesecake bits taste funny,1,1,Wish I could say I liked this but the cheesecake bits had such an off flavor did not taste like cheesecake at all. Disappointed.;;;
"Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake,DNA46n2,2018-12-03,4,Excellent not too sweet balance!,0,0,""Hubs brought this home when Americone Dream was out. I was skeptical because I don't love things super sweet. This was PERFECT! Varied textures (although it lacks a CRUNCH but thats ok) with lightly changing flavors. Not over powering sweet, I enjoyed the cheesecake pieces and like others could use a touch more of the graham but I will no doubt get again.""";;;
"Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake,ClaudyMiami,2019-01-28,5,Best icream flavor to date!,0,0,""I accidentally bought this at my local cvs one night and saw it was new, so said “I love cheesecake, why not?” WOW Saddened to not find it in the store again but never in my life have I seached online to see where I can find an icecream flavor (lol) and this has inspired me to do just that! Another level delicious, hope this stays around!""";;;
"Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake,Flavour connoisseur,2020-08-16,4,Good in theory,0,0,""The cookie swirl and ice cream base is delicious, the cheesecake, like everyone else has said, is not. Frozen cheesecake barely has any flavour and let’s be honest, cheesecake isn’t that good to begin with. If the cheesecake was replaced with cookie dough and a salted caramel swirl was added this would be the best ice cream... like ever.""";;;
Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake,NewFavNewFlav,2019-05-06,5,Omgsh! Instantly became a favorite,0,0,Purchased this flavor on a whim last night. Decided to taste it today & just like that I am a fan & will absolutely repurchase! I would like a little more cheesecake bites in the mix (because I enjoyed it so much) but I love the unique combination & how the flavors complement each other nonetheless. This one is definitely a keeper!;;;
"Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake,Lili,2018-06-19,5,Yes. Yes. Yes.,0,0,""This new flavor is amazing. I don't buy ice cream from the grocery store often. My all time favorite has been the turtle sundae from a local place or two, and not much can top it. Occasionally I buy a B&J pint and have found a few I really like, like salted caramel core. This new flavor has possibly risen to the top of the list.""";;;
Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake,tankdayglo,2018-07-03,2,Coconut oil overpowers,0,2,The overwhelming coconut oil flavor in the cheesecake truffles made this flavor unpleasant overall. I enjoyed the cookie swirl but the fake caramel cheesecake flavor of the base ice cream was also not great. If it had been a more simple base flavor & no coconut oil in the truffles this could have been a solid flavor.;;;
Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake,Cleo,2020-06-04,5,So GOOD!,0,0,I was recommended this ice cream by a friend a few weeks ago and have been obsessed with it! I'm not at all ashamed to admit I have eaten at least 4 or 5 pints since then and its my new favorite flavor. The ice cream is light and sweet and the cookie swirl adds a nice crunch. Would definitely recommend!;;;
Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake,Justice2087,2019-04-05,4,Needs more truffles!!!,0,0,I bought one a month ago for the second time and it was cheesecake chocolate swirl after truffle after truffle greatness.

Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake,Sk8djday,2019-07-26,5,Best ice cream ever,0,0,Bought this 3 times now. I love the chunkiness. There subtle salty almost sour of the cheesecake.

However, I barely had any cheesecake pieces and the caramel was SUPER light. The formula should be revamped to include more cheesecake and caramel. Still good Though.""";;;
"Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake,MagkMary,2020-04-12,4,Not the same,0,0,""I was reading the reviews on this, and most of them are for the Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake *Truffle* flavor. This is not the same flavor. It isn't bad, but it isn't as good as it's predecessor. =( I am bummed out.""";;;
Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake,Rylariaizmik,2020-05-07,3,What happened?,0,0,This used to be my Friday night guilty pleasure when it was truffles and now I feel like I've wasted $4. Why was this changed? The cheesecake pieces are too big and the flavor is different. I won't be buying it again.;;;

Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake,RottenHead,2019-01-24,5,This is a Kiss From God,0,0,The ice cream is so good it's ridiculous and the cookie swirl makes me emotional. The cheesecake truffles are not as good as the cheesecake in the 'Core' pint. This is a must try for all humans!;;;
Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake,cj1100,2019-04-19,5,Delicious!!,0,0,Love this flavor. The cheesecake bits are less creamy than expected but they are frozen so it makes sense. I love the caramel ice cream and wish there was more of the chocolate cookie!!! So good!;;;

Cherry ice cream combined with cherries and chunks of chocolate? Come on. This is the best flavor of all time. I'm not saying there aren't other delicious flavors that fill me with intense, creamy, passionate emotion, but cherry garcia is home. Cherry garcia is the dog that you cuddle up with on the couch after a long day of dragging your feet through the world. Cherry garcia is the mother that rubs your sweet lil head after the local school bully called your shoes """"dorky."""" Cherry garcia is life. Such a wonderful flavor. I'm a life-long fan and I will pass this flavor on to my kids, my kids' kids, and their kids' kids. I love it.""";;;
"Cherry Garcia,Mari724,2020-04-15,1,Very Disappointed!!!!!,1,8,""We bought 2 pints of Cherry Garcia yesterday at our local Frys Store in San Tan Valley, AZ. This has been my favorite flavor for more than 23 years. Unfortunately my husband and I are very disappointed. This ice cream does not taste like anything at all. The first thing we noticed was that it had no color at all, it was like eating plain cream. The only taste was the occasional piece of chocolate and a piece of cherry. I only had a quarter of the pint, the rest will go in the garbage. So Sad.""";;;
"Cherry Garcia,Tiffany,2017-10-29,5,""Try it, you’ll like it!"",13,0,""I’ve held off on this flavor for years. It seemed simple and less than exciting. Ben and Jerry’s is my secret soul food, so when I do it, I pick overtly decadent and rich like Phish Food. I got stuck with this when the hubby picked for me and he loves “cherry” anything. So, needless to say, I was so not happy inside to see Cherry Garcia. I even left it in time out in the freezer a whole day! I pulled it out the next day, fully expecting disappointment. Took a bite or two, and couldn’t stop! This is now my favorite ice cream of all time!! There’s a special sweet balance between the chunks of frozen cherries and giant chunks of frozen chocolate all generously dispersed in mellow vanilla. Every single bite was heaven! But don’t tell my husband! Gotta keep him on his toes!""";;;

"Cherry Garcia,Chewbacca,2018-05-13,5,""Just one teeny, tiny complaint..."",3,1,""I've eaten this flavor for a decade or more. It's definitely my go to, but, if I could change anything about it I would change ratio of cherries to chocolate in favor of cherries by at least 8:1. If not more. Honestly I'd say leave the chocolate out period but I know there'd be war. I just can't get enough of the cherries. And sometimes I get a pint that's almost all fudge chips & no cherries. Frustrating. But it's still the best current flavor.""";;;

Cherry Garcia,zoey,2018-08-21,2,i guess i’m the only one who doesn’t like this.,2,0,maybe i had a bad batch. but the “cherry ice cream” had no cherry flavor at all. it tasted like pure milk with just chunks of cherry throughout. and then bits of fudge flakes. they just tasted like pieces off a dark chocolate bar. i guess this flavor is just not for me;;;
"Cherry Garcia,Forget It,2017-07-08,1,Disappointing,3,11,""Since the takeover of B&J, it has become increasingly difficult to find my favorite Cherry Garcia.

And it """"ain't"""" pink ice cream any more - whitish/yellowish bland tasting stuff. Why would you want to screw up the best ice cream ever??

It’s so perfect with the right ratio of the creamy vanilla ice cream, chunks of dark chocolate (which I know might make u standoffish but trust me it goes amazing together) and the amazing juicy cherries. Every time I go to my local store I grab a pint because it’s just so delicious you always need to have it near by!""";;;
"Cherry Garcia,chev,2018-07-06,5,,0,0,""It's not difficult to see why Ben & Jerry's has used this flavor in so many different products, because it is a good, safe flavor and for that reason, it gets a BUY IT rating.

Cherry Garcia,skaizgay,2019-03-05,5,,0,0,Such an amazing ice cream unlike any other. The cherries in this are surprisingly fresh. I'm not usually a fan of ice cream with fruit because the fruit is usually very soft and mushy but the cherries in this are firm and fresh. The ice cream itself is very creamy and the chocolate is the perfect amount of cocoa without being too dark.;;;

Have tried many varieties, and have a few we buy regularly, but Cherry Garcia is my husband and son's all time favorite!! We purchase an average of one per week of this flavor. Over the years it's always been pretty consistant in taste and formulation, however the last few pints we purchased had much less chocolate chunks. One pint seemed to have a few chunks only on the bottom of the pint. My husband said """"WHERE ARE THE CHOCOLATE CHUNKS'??"""" Happened to the chocolate""""??? We think it must have been a fluke in manufactuing and we caught a bad batch as we purchased both pints in the same store. We had this problem with the lack of chocolate chunks in their Cherry Garcia slices, but untll now, never the pints. In """"fairness"""" I am giving this product a high rating because this issue with the lack of chocolate chunks has only been with the last 2 pints we purchased, and overall it's a good product...""";;;

In a fit of anger and depression I bought this as a comfort food since my usual choices of Karamel Sutra and Urban Bourbon weren't available. And wow. It seriously was so good that it took the edge off the anger and actually made me forget about my stupid health insurance issues for a good 45 minutes. It made those happy brain chemicals kick into gear better than sitting in a room full of puppies. Thank you for making an otherwise crummy day just a little bit better <3;;;

You have been able to make a coffee flavor icecream with actual coffee flavor, and the coffee liqour truffles? are you kidding me?! Deliscious. This flavor ice cream has just bumped into my #2 containered ice cream and i don’t make these decisions lightly. Well done ben and jerry, well done. its not just about the stuff you put in the icecream, the base flavor makes it, and you hit it out of the park with chillin the roast.""";;;
"Chillin' the Roast,nickdemon1,2020-07-14,5,FANTASTIC AUTHENTIC COFFEE FLAVOR,9,0,""I recently bought this a week ago and have already bought 3. I was most surprised at the authenticity of the coffee flavor. The smooth and [satisfyingly] rich chocolate swirls were a perfect combination when mixed with the ice cream. The chocolate covered truffles were just an added bonus to the already delicious product. My 22 y/o girlfriend who does not enjoy drinking coffee itself """"too much"""", also loves this ice cream flavor. 1000/10 (not a typo) would recommend to any coffee lover and non-coffee lover alike.""";;;
"Chillin' the Roast,Bennjerryfanforlofe,2019-09-28,1,The truffles are horrid in this flavor,16,5,""I was super excited to try this new flavor, I've been a big Ben & Jerry's fan for over 25 years. The cold brew coffee ice cream is actually quite tasty and the chocolate fudge swirl is fantastic. But the truffles are absolutely horrific and I'm picking them out as I eat through my pint. They taste like this very bad chemically bourbon flavored ball of nastiness. I don't even know how to describe it they certainly don't have any coffee flavor to them at all it really does taste like a fake chemically flavored alcohol additive. Disappointed and a complete waste of money.""";;;
"Chillin' the Roast,Lmcg91,2018-07-31,5,BEST COFFEE ICE CREAM EVER!,8,1,""I almost did not buy this flavor in my weekly shopping selection because it had “coffee” in the flavor.

BUT THEN I tried this ice cream with coffee flavor and the liquor, coffee etc, whatever all is in this makes it absolutely delicious. My store is out of it - I’ve checked 3 stores! I hope it’s not gone forever!!! LOVE THIS FLAVOR!""";;;
"Chillin' the Roast,Tubs123,2018-05-28,3,""Was good, but not great"",18,10,""There were things I liked and some I didn't. Firstly, I really did enjoy the cold brew coffee ice cream. It wasn't very sweet and was strong of coffee flavor, which I liked. If you're a fan of sugary coffee, this probably won't be for you. The fudge swirls tasted good as well, but there wasn't enough in my opinion.""";;;
"Chillin' the Roast,NaeWavyGravy,2020-02-12,2,Not Impressed,4,9,""This had the usual new label on it so of course I needed to buy it. I opened and tasted it and well it has very nice flavors, however the flavors are rather lingering. I am also one that enjoys """"stuff"""" in the ice cream and this was rather lacking. The swirl was ok, rather thick and sticky also has that liquor flavoring however the wafers were lacking and rather thin for the thickness of the swirl. The ice cream is Ben and Jerry's it's always good, however this flavor wasn't to my liking the flavor had kin of a grit to it. Other than that it was ice cream and I do love Ice cream!! I'd suggest a friend try it to compare it to my views...other than that not so much!""";;;
"Chillin' the Roast,robinf,2018-06-12,2,""Had high hopes, did not deliver"",5,19,""When my two favorite flavors, Oat of this Swirled and One Sweet World, sadly disappeared from my store, I turned to this flavor. I like Coffee Coffee, Buzz, Buzz, Buzz, but I wanted to try something new from the truffles line. Despite opening this up to a giant air bubble (picture attached), I hoped for a successful flavor. I'm not sure if I can email customer service about this air bubble as I had recently already found one- which would make it look sketchy if I emailed. However, I was very disappointed. The cold brew ice cream is bitter and has a weird aftertaste, and the truffles had a somewhat chalky texture. I would not recommend this flavor, but if you are against wasting ice cream and do not want to throw it out, try eating it with some sort of chocolate or chocolate based ice cream.""";;;
"Chillin' the Roast,Anonymous too,2018-08-26,1,No thank you,12,18,""I hoped this would be a replacement for my former favorite, the original coffee heath bar. NOPE! The ice cream flavor is horrible. Advertised as cold brewed. Tastes more like a pot of Dunkin that has sat on the burner all day. The rum is unpleasant and I can't even describe the """"truffles"""". I probably would have been more satisfied with something generic and unoriginal. If you insist on trying to be trendy and adding booze to your ice cream, why not start with something safe and unimaginative like an Irish coffee with a local whiskey and maybe a caramel swirl.""";;;

I usually opt for the trusty Tonight Dough, but was delighted to see some new flavors. This one in particular, """"Chillin' the Roast Truffles,"""" immediately grabbed my attention. I'm a coffee lover/addict, and I do enjoy a good chocolate truffle. I figured this flavor would be right up my alley. BUT... I was wrong. The coffee ice cream is actually pretty good.

When I saw this product, I ventured away from my typical ice cream choice of Tonight Dough, and I was downright ecstatic to try it out. Did I think that it would measure up to Tonight Dough or S'more? No. But, I did expect more than what I got. It just did not live up to the quality one would expect from a Ben and Jerry's ice cream. I would not recommend. It tastes like a weird type of coffee ice cream. The truffles are too sweet, and the 'fudge' ribbons in the product do not taste like fudge to me. They are very rich. I am sure some people might enjoy it, I however was disappointed. I came in expecting at least an 8, and left with half a pint of ice cream and a strong 4.""";;;
Chillin' the Roast,Bjsup3531,2018-03-22,3,Not bad but not great,6,1,The ice cream itself is really good. Strongest coffee tasting ice cream I've had from Ben and jerry's. The truffle part is disgusting though and there isn't much of a fudge swirl. What I mean by much is nun at all basically.;;;

My favorite Coffee, Coffee, Buzz, Buzz, Buzz flavor has apparently been discontinued in my neck of the woods. The only place I can actually find it is at the little Ben & Jerry's stand in our local mall. The flavor of the ice cream itself is great. I even enjoyed the swirls of fudge. The coffee liqueur was disgusting. It tarnished the whole pint of ice cream for me. I was strong and bitter, just not a pleasant taste. I tried to eat around it, but I ended up throwing the container out. Back to purchasing hand packed pints of my favorite from the local mall. Hopefully they will never stop ordering it.""";;;
"Chillin' the Roast,Anonymoose,2019-03-31,1,Overall disappointed,1,1,""I have 2 go to flavors when picking B&J, but craved coffee ice cream and decided to branch out. The cold brew sounded amazing, the cookie crumble is my favorite part about The Tonight Dough, and the liquor truffle sounded great considering the complemented flavors. The cold brew ice cream was left a little lacking in my opinion but was edible. The fudge and cookie crumble was really good, but I could not get over the truffle itself. It tasted too strong and overpowered everything else, which I wouldn’t mind, if it had tasted good. It was too strong, and too fake of a liquor taste. I love you B&J, your Tonight Dough and Phish Food are amazing, but the truffle just didn’t cut it for me, and the ice cream itself was lacking.""";;;
"Chillin' the Roast,FuzzyGut,2018-07-05,3,Not bad...,2,0,""Not bad, but the other Ben and Jerry’s coffee flavors are better, in my opinion. The ice cream was very good but the truffles were too strong for my taste, and a little strange. The chocolate swirl was also a little too intense. You can definitely taste that it’s cold brew as opposed to regular coffee and it’s impressive that B&J was able to capture that difference. No amateur ice cream makers, this group.""";;;
"Chillin' the Roast,SRDine,2018-03-19,1,It is not good,5,5,""I love Ben & Jerry's. I especially love the mocha and coffee flavored ice creams, so I was very excited to try Chillin' the Roast. I am sorry to report it is by far the worst B&J flavor that I've ever tried. The cold brew flavored ice cream was fine, it was not offensive and with the right add-ins it could have been a decent flavor. However, the truffles were terrible";" they tasted sour and occasionally a little like blue cheese. I'm sad this was so bad, I wanted to love it.""";;
"Chillin' the Roast,Chigirl312,2018-07-29,5,My new favorite!,1,0,""I had two or 3 pints of this before not being able to find it. It’s my new favorite after Coffee Heath Bar changed its ingredients and was no longer irresistible. The coffee flavor is a little different, not as sweet — and the truffles, true to their name, have a liquer flavor. Wonderful combination if you love coffee! I guess on one hand, I’m relieved not to be eating it regularly since losing weight has been easier, but I miss finding it on my grocery trips...please restock!!""";;;
"Chillin' the Roast,CW784,2018-07-01,4,For espresso lovers,1,0,""I actually really loved the coffee flavor of this ice cream. My usual favorite is Coffee Coffee Buzz Buzz Buzz, but I can only ever find that in scoop shops (which I rarely patronize). The Chillin' the Roast Truffles was available at my grocery store so I pounced. It has a taste that people who enjoy dark roast coffee, plain cold brew, black coffee, or deep espressos will enjoy in my opinion. A lot of coffee ice creams just have a very mild coffee flavor you can barely detect beneath the plain sugar and cream flavor. This was true coffee and tasted excellent.""";;;

I was super stoked to crack it open tonight and dive into the creamy dream the description promised, only to be disappointed. The ice cream was grainy, the fudge was entirely overpowered by bitter cold brew, & the truffles tasted of nothing but bitter coconut--I had to stop eating and double check the flavour listing to be sure I hadn't made a mistake. This blend missed the mark, but at least there's rum in it? Hopefully b&j Wil try again at a coffee & chocolate combo, & hopefully it will be better than this.""";;;

They are incredibly different in every way, from color to taste to ingredients, so I wouldn't compare the two. I would like the ice cream on its own, the cold brew ice cream would be good with chocolate chips as a iced-mocha flavor concept. But with these truffles, listed as """"chocolate-cookie covered liqueur truffles"""", the chocolate (which tastes just like chocolate, not sure where the cookie is), does not stay attached to the truffle inside. The liqueur truffle itself is the consistency of cookie butter, I was expecting the something harder. They definitely give a bit of a kick, which may not be what you are into.

This is the first BJ review I have ever given, and I actually came to the website to see if I had gotten a bad batch, or if everyone else had the same reaction to this flavor. Bitter and sour taste.""";;;
"Chillin' the Roast,Smedley,2018-03-24,1,So disappointing!,1,1,""I always look forward to new flavors so I had to try this one. I have to say that this is the worst flavor I have ever tried! Weak coffee flavor, no sign of a chocolate swirl and the truffles were inedible. This is the first pint of Ben and Jerry’s that I could not finish.""";;;
"Chillin' the Roast,Fishngal,2018-03-27,5,Best appreciated by TRUE coffee addicts,1,1,""I thought this flavor was AMAZING. Though I’m not a huge coffee liquer fan, you get exactly what they advertise. I thought the truffles complimented the overall flavor, which is definitely overwhelmingly deliciously rich strong coffee. Love it, new favorite for sure.""";;;
"Chillin' the Roast,cgm13,2018-12-31,1,Textures and Tastes Way Off,0,0,""I normally love Ben and Jerry's, and coffee is my weakness... this though. Just a miss. I didn't care for the taste or the texture of the truffles-- very weird. I agree around them for a whole, but ultimately threw away more of the pint than its ever have imagined. The swirls were alright, but the gritty texture of the coffee grounds in the ice cream was way too much for me. Sorry, guys. This was not a winner.""";;;
"Chillin' the Roast,Heyhanhey,2018-06-09,2,""Actual ice cream, delicious. Truffles are a fail."",0,0,""I was torn between the two new truffle flavors, and decided to go with this one. The cold brew coffee ice cream is a LITTLE grainy but not like others I’ve had. The texture of the truffles was nice, but the flavor was a total turn off. I ended up eating around them until they were too hard to avoid. Then I threw the rest away. Granted, I’m not a booze person, but the truffle flavor was truly acrid. Too bad!""";;;
"Chillin' the Roast,Ntim,2018-04-23,1,The only flavor I can’t eat,1,2,""I love Ben & Jerry’s and I love coffee, but the coffee liquor “truffles” are strong and nasty. And it tastes like crushed coffee beans throughout the ice cream and not in a good way. Hardly any chocolate (at least not in the pint I purchased). I never say this, (but this is an exception), this flavor is a flop.""";;;
"Chillin' the Roast,Reannanqueen,2020-08-24,3,Not a great combo,0,0,""I bought this simply because the flavor I REALLY wanted wasn't on the shelf and I figured """"why not?"""" The description on front sounded great but I was slightly disappointed to find light colored ice cream when I took off the lid (I don't care for vanilla) but one bite in, I was a fan. The cold-brew coffee flavor is powerful and is even better than the flavor of ice cream in Coffee BuzzBuzzBuzz! And the fudge swirls match that flavor perfectly. But what I found did not fit well were the truffles. They added a bitter taste and I found they did not mesh well with the other flavors. I figured I could just eat around them or scoop them out. Sadly, the shells are to fragile and broke when I tried this. After 15 mins of trying to avoid their bitterness, I ended up throwing the pint away. I was able to enjoy about a quarter of the ice cream and fudge. Awesome effort but needs adjustment (imo.)""";;;
"Chillin' the Roast,scoops,2018-03-26,3,""Best B&J's Coffee Base, But Not a Fan of Truffles"",1,2,""Cold brew base is more of an espresso type, studded with flecks of coffee.

For me, they ruined the pint""";;
"Chillin' the Roast,Hans,2019-05-26,5,A special occasion flavor for adults,0,0,""This is for adults. This is delicious. This may be my favorite flavor in decades, but it is a flavor to be savored and even thought about. It's very complex, and you should enjoy it at various temperatures to get all the coffee flavors. The texture is relatively simple, and the chocolate around the truffles could be slightly darker and nicer, but bravo to whoever put this recipe together.""";;;
"Chillin' the Roast,Riso,2019-05-02,1,Threw It In The Garbage,0,0,""This flavor is so bad that Chillin' the Roast is the first pint of Ben & Jerry's that I ever threw in the garbage. It has a very odd, un-ice-cream like texture and weird flavors. It's kind of foamy and the flavors are so strange that I can't even describe them. I looked at the ingredients and it's full of gums, carrageenan, canola and soybean oils and 'natural flavors'. Mystery solved.""";;;
"Chillin' the Roast,kingkyle,2018-07-28,1,Not for me. Probably not you either.,0,0,""I actually accidentally grabbed a pint of this, I was want the Chocolate Cheesecake Truffle. I got messed up by the both being truffle ice cream! However I was already home when I realized it. The taste of this ice cream is horrible. It's souer and the coffee over powers everything else. I only ate a few spoons and I was done. Probably the worst ice cream I've ever tasted.""";;;

Chillin' the Roast,Loraine,2019-05-26,1,Unfortunate Flavor,0,0,I love cold brew coffee and I love coffee ice creams. The truffles were a huge let down and didn't really taste much like coffee and had a weird alcohol liqeur thing going on. Also there was a air pocket in the bottom of my pint so I was missing about a quarter of product. I wish my local stores carried the other coffee flavors because this one did not meet the mark.;;;

Then the taste test. The ice cream and the fudge were fine, but the “truffles” were gross. I can’t describe the flavor, but it was very unpleasant. I doubt I’ll eat any more then the small sample I had.""";;;

"Chillin' the Roast,Lovelylashaee,2018-05-01,4,Pretty good,0,0,""I loved the cold brew ice cream and the chocolate cookie crust, however the coffee liqueur truffle inside the cookie crust was super sweet and I could only handle about 2 chunks.

Chillin' the Roast,eli22,2019-06-04,2,Tastes fuzzy,0,0,I usually love any Ben & Jerry's but unfortunately this is a big miss - I don't know any better way to describe it than to say it tastes kind of fuzzy. I'd rather have coffee flavored ice cream than the cold brew grounds even if the flavor is stronger. And the truffles are as bad as people say. Yikes.;;;
Chillin' the Roast,Kaitlin,2018-11-21,5,A+++,0,0,Normally I can only eat a tiny amount of Ben and Jerry’s. I almost devoured this pint in one sitting.

So finally I put on some Guilty pleasure reality television snugged into my couch with my favorite blanket and my favorite ice cream only to notice that after a couple spoonfuls......NO COOKIE DOUGH!

"Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough,Jason,2018-04-06,5,Favorite Since Childhood,14,2,""Ben & Jerry's Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough ice cream has been a favorite of mine since I was a kid. I always appreciated the rich vanilla ice cream and chunks of flavorful cookie dough (the dough isn't dry and flavorless like some other cookie dough ice creams). Sometimes you don't want a busy ice cream with too many extras and this is perfect. I usually go into it with the goal of only eating half the container, but always end up finishing it in one sitting. Classic, reliable, and delicious.""";;;

Will not be buying again as 3 times for this to happen is more than enough.

Where is the Cookie Dough?!,11,4,""After trying B&Js for the first time (Half Baked which was absolutely DELICIOUS), I became a recent fan and had to come back and try their Cookie Dough flavour. Well, what a complete waste of money! I am well aware that B&J has always been more expensive than other ice cream brands (especially living in Australia) but have always been happy to pay more for a premium product. Little did I know, I would open my tub to discover next to no cookie dough in the whole thing! What's the point of having a couple of teeny millimeter specks? Why pay more for this product when you can get perfectly fine vanilla ice cream from a competitor at a lower cost?! My last experience with Half Baked was amazing but now I'm personally unsure whether I will repurchase a B&J product again as I don't want to repeat this experience of buyers remorse and utter disappointment.""";;;

Unfortunately, my most recent experience was less than satisfying. The pieces of dough felt like they were missing a few ingredients.

"Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough,Clark,2019-01-15,5,Underrated,2,0,""Maybe it's not the most exciting flavor, but the contrast of the plain (but very good) vanilla ice cream and the ambrosia-like cookie dough chunks makes this flavor one of the most enjoyable to eat.

Ben & Jerrys is usually awesome for me, a 4/5 stars typically (and Im a very tough ice cream critic) but this one just wasnt one of their better flavors. Now, this may be my fault because it is a rather stereotypical simple flavor, and I usually only get it at ice cream shops because their cookie dough and ice cream just taste better for some reason. So Im comparing this to my top favorite fresh cookie dough ice cream at ice cream shops, and to ben & Jerrys other more exciting flavors. If youre struggling to choose which brand of cookie dough ice cream you want at the store, just for the ben & Jerrys, its for sure one of the best brands for that flavor.""";;;

My biggest complaint with this is that there isn't enough cookie dough, and I don't think it's because of some mistake in the manufacturing process. It kind of tastes like vanilla ice cream with the occasional chunk of dough. You could seriously improve this flavor if you increased the amount of cookie dough you put into these pints.""";;;

The soft chewy brownies and the best part and three times now I have been let down. Each purchase was made several months apart, hoping the quality control issue was fixed. Nope. They were purchased and Walmart twice and Walgreens the most recent time. This was my absolute favorite ice cream flavor, but I think I’m done wasting $5 on being disappointed each time. Ben and Jerry’s, please figure this out. I saw that you commented that this happens when the ice cream melts and refreezes. You really need to contact your vendors and get this worked out.""";;;

A few months ago a bought a pint and there was only one giant hunk of hard crumbly brownie in the center, I couldn't even eat it. I was disappointed but thought it was a freak thing. Since then I have tried it again from different stores, and different flavors i.e. Half baked and the chocolate fudge brownie pint slices. Again the brownies have been crumbly and chalky. And there weren't many brownie pieces in the them or any fudge swirls. I hope they change the brownies back to the way they were so I can enjoy my favorite treat again!""";;;
"Chocolate Fudge Brownie,,2020-06-16,1,Only thing I wanted after having my baby,17,4,""So disappointed! I struggled with gestational diabetes and was unable to indulge in sweet treats for my whole pregnancy. When I gave birth to our sweet baby boy, I was allowed to have my Ben & Jerry's again. The store was out of half baked so my husband brought me fudge brownie. Couldn't even get through a proper bite because the brownies were just a crumbly/icy mess and the ice cream was sticky and solidified. I thought it had expired but it's good until Sept 2018! I was so upset. I'm afraid to have him go buy more pints if this is the result. I keep hearing about their new flavors but I waited 9 months for a regular pint and it was thrown in the trash-my husband couldn't even stomach it and he eats everything.""";;;

Ever since I have tryed Ben and Jerrys ice cream I never thought i would find another ice cream that would beat it, and you know what I have not found a better one... and I probably never will. I am only 25 but I have traveled ALOT. I lived in Amsterdam for 3 years and I have tasted and tryed many different chocolate ice creams all arownd Europe and nothing even comes close.

However, recently i've found that I can't enjoy this ice cream like I used to, because of the disgusting little chunks of hardness in the brownie bits. There's nothing more insulting than biting into a """"great baked good"""" and instead having your teeth grit because of the inability to chew the extremely hard pieces in the brownie. I thought maybe it was a one time thing, so I bought another container. The second container had the exact same issue.

In fact, take a look at your pic compared to mine--totally different experiences as your pic represents what I am accustomed to enjoying and mine is a poor copycat version with crumbly bits of what appear to be and taste like inadequately mixed brownie pieces. Honestly, the ice cream would have been better without the add-ins. After reading other customers' experiences, I think I am going to write this one off my favorites list.""";;;
"Chocolate Fudge Brownie,Melanie,2019-08-26,1,I noticed you must read and fix issues????????,1,0,""My girlfriend and I got some of this ice cream all because it’s her favorite. She dug into it to find dry, gross brownies. We were like what? Went and bought another thinking the first must have frozen wrong or something. She dug into it and it as well was the same way. I love Ben and Jerry’s ice cream. I will go out of my way to get some. But now I’m rethinking this. The reviews go on and on for several years worth. If you don’t fix a problem that’s been on going, how am I sure the rest of your ice cream isn’t going to have problems like this. Sorry but I just can’t chance it.""";;;

I have been eating Ben & Jerry's for quite some time now. Today I purchased it and must have bought a bad batch. The """"fudge brownie"""" pieces were dry, crumbly, and tan in color-not like usual! It didn't taste like the normal batch either- I was so sad because after 2 bites I just couldn't handle it anymore. I just bought it today and it wasn't even close to the Expiration date either. Disappointed :(""";;;
Chocolate Fudge Brownie,Tally,2017-08-08,2,Disappointed,8,1,The chocolate ice cream itself is very good but the last couple pints I've bought all had hard brownie bites. They're so dry they crack as soon as you bite into them.;;;

I stopped getting it for a while and switched to Half baked....the brownies were hard AGAIN even in that. Now I've been forced to buy other brands but none can even compare to what once was the best ice cream known to man. Sadly not anymore.""";;;

I’ve purchased 3 pints in the last six months or so and they were absolutely delicious! Soft chewy brownie pieces and wonderful ice cream. However this time the brownies are awful. They are rock hard rectangular chunks I can barely scoop out and when eating them they are just dry, hard, and crumbly. Not worth the $5!!!! I probably won’t try again as this seems to be an ongoing issue for other customers as well. It was my favourite ice cream:(""";;;

And to pin point the problem area, the brownies were burnt and dry.""";;;
Chocolate Fudge Brownie,Freddiegee,2017-09-07,3,What used to be,6,2,I have been buying this for a long time but it's not the same anymore. you guys have the best chocolate ice cream but the brownies have totally declined lately.

We haven't had any Ben and Jerry's in a few years. Chocolate fudge brownie used to be my absolute favorite. We each tried one bite and all hated it. The brownies were hard and the ice cream tasted really weird. The coffee toffee crunch wasn't much better. I guess they changed the ingredients. Doesn't taste like a premium ice cream. It's not even as good as a cheap ice cream! Definitely won't buy again!""";;;
Chocolate Fudge Brownie,Michael G,2020-09-24,1,So disapointed,0,0,This used to be heaven in a cup.

However I’ve recently switched to different flavors because the consistency is very bad regarding the brownie chunks. I understand the issue regarding handling but if you cannot control the quality of your product through your vendors, well that’s concernjng for your product. I look forward to the company regulating handling so I can come back to my beloved flavor. Meanwhile, your other flavors are definitely keeping me busy!!""";;;
Chocolate Fudge Brownie,Marissak,2017-08-16,2,So disappointed,3,3,I haven't had any of these ice creams in about 8 or 9 months and to celebrate my nephews birthday I took him to get one since I don't get to see him besides every couple months. Well when we got home for his party he took a bite and immediately spit it out. So i tried it and noticed it just didn't taste the same and the brownies were either overcooked just not made correctly. It's such a shame because this was my favorite brand but I can't afford the price for it just to be thrown in the trash :(;;;

The other half, it's hardly any brownie, or it's a whitish color in the brownie and it's crunchy (not how it normally is, which is soft) or the brownie is mushy. So, it's a basically a 50/50 shot of getting my money's worth. I love this ice cream but I'm starting to wonder why this happens?""";;;

Whether I was stressed out or just in the mood for something delicious I would turn to old faithful. I stopped eating this flavor for awhile when all the new flavors came in, but no too long ago by husband bought me this by mistake instead of the brownie core (another fav), and I forgot how amazing this ice cream was. I started getting this again. I love brownies, and they're not stingy with the brownie bite size and that's much appreciate. This ice cream was the reason why I fell in love with B&J in the first place, so it will always have a special place in my heart.""";;;

Chocolate Fudge Brownie,beach patty,2020-02-11,1,Not what it use to be!,0,0,The only ice cream I've eaten for years is the Chocolate Fudge Brownie. Was always my absolute favorite but lately the brownies are light colored and crunchy and so disgusting that I have thrown most of the last few containers out. Have you changed something? I noticed you said that it could be from improper handling and refreezing. If that was the case I think the ice cream would have ice crystals in it. For the price of over $5 I will have to reconsider brands of ice cream. I don't mind paying the price but lately it's just not worth it. I'm sooo sad.;;;

It’s terrible. Just last week they were doing buy 5 and get them for $3.99 each, so best believed I bought ten because what a steal.or so I thought.....

"Chocolate Fudge Brownie,BringBackFudgyBrownies,2020-01-05,1,Used to be amazing,0,0,""This has to be my favorite ice cream flavor BUT, it is a 1 in 5 chance that you get a good pint. Lately every pint that I get have dry crumbly brownies like it's just frozen brownie powder. I have wasted so much money buying this flavor in hopes of getting a good batch. The last 4 pints I bought from the store were all bad and I had to throw all of them away.""";;;
"Chocolate Fudge Brownie,Vesna,2018-08-23,5,Best chocolate ice cream ever,0,0,""On a whim I tried this, altho I am not into ice creams that have anything but chocolate swirl or chips in it. I loved this, I have purchased a couple times and each time the brownie pieces were soft and chewy. But I would buy it just for the deep, rich chocolate ice cream, so good! And no nuts in it, thank you--I am not a big fan of nuts in my ice cream""";;;
Chocolate Fudge Brownie,Ashmar,2017-08-28,5,So good!,0,2,BOGO this week at the grocery store and haven't had this flavor in forever and decided to pick it up this week and it's just SO AMAZING.

"Chocolate Fudge Brownie,AJourneyThroughIceCream,2020-07-12,5,Amazing flavor,0,0,""Got this flavor a few days ago to start my journey of trying all flavors, and I am glad to say I wasn’t disappointed. Even though the grocery store I got it from gave it freezer burn I couldn’t have asked for a better pint of ice cream. Strongly recommended if you are in the feels and need a pick-me up.""";;;
"Chocolate Fudge Brownie,LBGA,2017-10-06,5,Personal Favorite,0,3,""I crave chocolate fudge brownie all the time. I'm not big on sweets and consitantly eat very healthy, but I have to have a couple bites every day of my Chocolate Fudge Brownie. It's the perfect balance of sweet chocolate with a touch of saltiness and smooth texture from the brownie. Yummy in every way!""";;;
Chocolate Fudge Brownie,PrinzessJasmine,2017-10-22,4,Wisdom Teeth,0,3,I just got my wisdom teeth removed and I had my mom pick up some ice cream. I was initially nervous about the brownie getting stuck in my teeth but I found that they dissolve between the roof of my mouth and my tounge. Nice rich flavor and texture. Helped soothe my sore throat after the surgery;;;
Chocolate Fudge Brownie,Ashleys,2020-05-27,3,Another brownie problem,0,0,This has been my favorite flavor since forever and now the brownies are all dry and crumbly. There aren’t many in my pint yet though with this consistency I don’t want them. The chocolate ice cream is really good but not this brownie mess. What happened!? I miss the gooey fudgy pieces!;;;
Chocolate Fudge Brownie,Nessyrae23,2017-06-02,5,Finally a chocolate ice cream for chocolate lovers,1,1,I love chocolate and I love ice cream but that doesn't mean I like chocolate ice cream. Who else hates when you open up a carton of chocolate ice cream and it's light tan and you know the flavor will be as weak as the color and you know before you take your first bite you'll be disappointed? I kind of gave up on ice cream for a long time because of that. It wasn't until I got a job at a Ben and jerrys scoop shop and saw how dark their chocolate fudge brownie ice cream is that I decided to try it. At that point I wasn't much of an ice cream eater and if wasn't called triple dark chocolate fudge I didn't want to try it and be disappointed. When I took my first bite I was really blown away by how rich and deep the flavor was. This is the way chocolate ice cream should be. It should be indulgent and intoxicating and not for the faint hearted. Then you add in the super moist and delicious brownies and it just doesn't get any better than that. Now I can't eat a lot of this. One scoop is enough bc it is so indulgent. I have to be in the mood for it. This is my go to when I've had a bad day and I need comfort. Since I tried this I have become a loyal Ben and jerrys customer. The scoop shop closed a while back which is sad because it was a cool place. But bottom line is Ben and jerrys are the only brand that makes real chocolate ice cream the way it should be made;;;
Chocolate Fudge Brownie,Steph,2017-07-14,5,Tried and true,0,0,This has been my favorite flavor since childhood. It's true that you need to be careful to get a pint at a more reputable place because if the freezer situation is iffy then hard brownies you will get. But usually it's extra decadent with chewy brownie bits in almost every bite.;;;
"Chocolate Fudge Brownie,Rebel of Mars 81,2019-07-16,5,Intense Chocolate!,0,0,""If you love semi-sweet and/or dark chocolate, you will love this ice cream. Only true chocolate lovers will be able to eat more than a couple spoonfuls. The brownie bits are rather large, they should be half to a quarter their current size, but they're really yummy and chewy.""";;;

Chocolate Fudge Brownie,hailley564,2019-07-02,2,Dry brownies,0,0,I usually buy half baked because the brownies are really good so I decided to go straight for the source.

I am a lover of Ben & Jerry's, have been for as long as I can remember and while some flavors are not typically my thing, this one is awesome! With the ice cream you get a smooth, creamy and full bodied chocolate malt ice cream, combined with a beautifully whipped marshmallow fluff type swirl. The ice cream mixed with this smooth heavenly marshmallow swirl would be enough for me but the addition of the cookie crumbled covered fudge bits, its joygasmic! Everything about this is a win, I really hope that this flavor stays around for a long time. If you want a smooth, creamy, satisfying chocolate ice cream....well, this one is for you!""";;;
Chocolate Shake It,eastwest,2019-04-11,5,This is my dream flavor,2,0,Where to begin. The explosive marshmallows? The creamy chocolate? The chewy truffles?;;;
"Chocolate Shake It,Cree,2018-06-10,2,Disappointed,8,7,""Something has gone terribly wrong at Ben & Jerry's. After my 2nd disappointing pint from them I was really hoping for a win. This flavor was incredibly bland. You can't call something chocolate malt just because it is light brown. I could not detect any malt flavor whatsoever and could barely taste chocolate. Even then I think it may have just been the truffles. The truffles were ok and there were plenty, but even the marshmallow swirl was also bland. Sweet tasting and I liked the soft texture but none of the flavors that were supposed to be in this were! Unfortunately I forgot to use my coupon and paid for this junk.""";;;
Chocolate Shake It,KirstenBuckeye,2018-03-28,3,Hoped for more marshmallow and truffles!,4,1,I am eating a pint of it right now and the ice cream is delicious. I wish the truffles weren’t as sparse though and wish there were more marshmallow swirl. I’m about halfway through the pint and can still hardly see any marshmallow.;;;
Chocolate Shake It,NaeWavyGravy,2018-09-07,2,Disappointed,1,2,I bought this a couple of days ago and to be honest that's a long time to have Ben & Jerry's in the house. This one really isn't for me. I don't like it at all. It doesn't really taste like a chocolate milkshake to me more of a chocolate malted base with a lite marshmallow swirl. The truffle could be a little smaller which would make it have more also I'd they were a darker chocolate or a richer chocolate maybe it would be better I'm not sure but this one doesn't work for me.;;;
"Chocolate Shake It,Kaya,2018-07-28,2,Bland and Odd Texture,9,8,""This one missed the mark for me. I understand the texture is meant to be more like a milkshake but I expected something different and it felt grainy. The flavor was bland for me, almost no milk chocolate flavor, closer to sweet cream. Even the marshmallow swirl was nothing like the S'mores swirl, it had a very artificial texture. The truffles were pretty good, but not as much cookie crunch as I expected and there weren't many of them. Overall, I'm disappointed. I love Ben and Jerry's but this one did not live up to the label.""";;;
"Chocolate Shake It,bgdl26,2018-03-26,5,Loved it but needs more truffles,3,0,""I've been obsessed with Tonight Dough for years and have yet to find a new flavor that I like as much until this one! I loved it! Tastes like a chocolate milk shake, love the marsh-mellow swirl and the cookie covered truffles were amazing, I just wish there were more in my pint. It seemed like I only had 4 or 5 but clearly there should be a lot more based on the photo. Anyway, it's still amazing.""";;;
"Chocolate Shake It,NotAChocoholic,2019-02-16,2,Average and Boring,0,0,""This may just be my anger speaking becuase I asked for one thing for Valentine's Day: Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake truffle. And what do I get? The most average chocolate icecream you can possibly from the Ben and Jerry's section of the freezer aisle.

"Chocolate Shake It,Chicksluvrock,2018-03-16,3,""Good, but not great"",2,0,""I was very excited to try this flavor, and although it was good, it isn’t as good as I thought it would be. The texture of the ice cream is wonderfully creamy, but I would have liked a more intense malty-chocolatey flavor....it’s pretty mild. The marshmallow swirls and truffles are tasty though....except mine could of used more truffles! Overall good but I think I’ll stick with my favorite flavor - peanut butter world!""";;;
"Chocolate Shake It,Chocolover779,2018-03-23,2,Unimpressed,3,0,""Overall I wasn’t impressed with this flavor, while it is very sweet, there isn’t much chocolate flavor.

The ice cream flavor in this is so delicious and tastes like you're drinking a malt milkshake. There's a lot of marshmallow (my favorite part) and a good amount of truffles, not TOO many but certainly not sparse. I will definitely purchase again, but only after I try the other two new ones!!""";;;
Chocolate Shake It,AllD,2018-04-22,5,This is everything I've ever wanted in icecream,1,0,I found this flavor yesterday after not buying ice-cream in a while. IT IS AMAZING. It tastes like you're eating a perfectly made milkshake. There's a little bit of some dryer flavor in the chocolate-cookie covered fudge but it levels out the entire flavor (one of the gripes I have with half baked is that it is too rich / gooey) and the marshmallow swirls tie it all together. Please never get rid of this and if you do let me know so I can stock up forever.;;;
"Chocolate Shake It,Turtledark,2019-01-16,1,A whole lot of meh,1,0,""Bought this a few days ago after finally finding it again. Maybe I built the flavors up in my head but for a Ben and Jerry's flavor, this seriously lacked. I LOVE malt, marshmallow, and truffles but it was just so bland. I tasted no malt but the ice cream was really creamy. The light chocolate taste was nice. The marshmallow was pretty consistent with every other flavor that includes it. I'm a major fish food fan. The truffles were what I had been looking forward to the most. I really liked the ones in the chillin the roast flavor. The truffles in this though had NO flavor! The only chocolate hint I tasted was from the thin coating";" definitely not a """"cookie crunch"""". Needless to say, I was disappointed. It wasn't bad. I mean, I love ice cream! I just really wish there was a real taste. If I wanted to vanilla, I would have gotten vanilla.""";;
"Chocolate Shake It,Dumb,2020-05-26,2,They changed the fudge pieces,0,0,""This used to be my all time favorite ice cream. Bought tons every time it was on sale, gobbled it down and then bought more at full price. Love love loved it. Until they changed the cookie covered fudge pieces. Apparently the new fudge pieces are salted and it destroys what this ice cream used to be about. That cookie crust was so well done and the fudge melted in your mouth. For whatever reason Ben and Jerry’s has decided to stop making a superior product. Instead they cop out and use salt to pique people’s taste buds. We don’t need more salt in our lives or diets! Bring back the original fudge pieces and make this ice cream great again! I can barely eat it since I discovered the unnecessary and “wool over our eyes” awful salted fudge mix up.""";;;
"Chocolate Shake It,Tomas,2019-03-26,1,No No No!,1,0,""Picked up about 10 various flavors the other day and """"Chocolate Shake It"""" was by far the worst. It was awful!

"Chocolate Shake It,Laurenisawesome,2018-07-10,2,Get the Phish Food instead,1,0,""The malt ice cream flavor is good, the cookie truffles are what brings the whole ice cream down. The truffles are bitter and too big. The size keeps it frozen and hard. The marshmallow swirl is amazing though. Then again why not just have the Phish Food which I think is similar but has the caramel to make it even better.""";;;
"Chocolate Shake It,Breezyj,2018-07-20,5,Excellence!,0,0,""I often feel a twinge of guilt purchasing Ben & Jerry’s over our many local brands, but yet again, the thoughtful, indulgent flavor combos are a league of their own.""";;;
"Chocolate Shake It,KaitlynC,2018-07-06,3,50/50,1,0,""I was extremely excited when I bought this icecream, and don’t regret it, the only thing I did not like about it was the chocolate truffles. They were extremely hard, and I felt like they were unnecessary in the icream. Other than that, the icecream was great, the taste was amazing, the marshmallow was great. 50/50""";;;
"Chocolate Shake It,,2019-05-02,5,Absolutely love it!,0,0,""I personally don’t like an overly strong chocolate flavor in my ice cream. I like black and white milkshakes, frozen custard, and chocolate malt because they all have a dialed down chocolate flavor. This ice cream is perfect for me, and the marshmallow is a perfect compliment. Sometimes it’s nice to have cleaner, more subtle flavors as opposed to overwhelming concoctions of bourbon pretzel cheesecake ice cream with peanut butter salted caramel brownie chunks or something equally extra. Really well done!""";;;
"Chocolate Shake It,FuzzyGut,2018-08-09,5,Yes please!,2,1,""What an awesome new flavor! First off, it really does taste like a chocolate milkshake. It’s light and creamy with the marshmallow swirl and the truffles are yummy too. Good job on this new flavor, B&J! Yum!""";;;

Chocolate Shake It,brianaa,2018-06-10,4,good but dont like the truffles,1,0,i loved the chocolate and marshmallow. thought i found the perfect flavor but the truffles tasted off and were too heavy compared to the consistency of the rest of product.;;;
Chocolate Shake It,Teecee,2020-03-15,5,Malt Shake Dreams Come True,1,0,I love malts so this is so delicious! The truffles are good too along w/ the marshallow bits. It's my favorite B&J's flavor & I hope it never stops getting made :D;;;

Chocolate Shake It,Icecreamfan4life,2018-04-17,2,Cool idea but wasn't quite a hit for me,1,2,Bought this pint and the cheesecake flavor a few days ago(haven't tried the other just yet). Thinking this would be something fun and different to try(even though I'm not a big chocolate ice cream fan aside from Wendy's Frosties). And have to say as I sit here eating it now. The Malt base does remind me of a Wendy's Frosty(which I enjoyed). But I honestly don't think that it pairs all that well with the marshmallow swirl or the cookie truffles(which I've gotten plenty of those and not fully sure if I like them or not. Great texture and pretty soft to munch on. But taste wise may not be my thing).;;;
Chocolate Shake It,lme2813,2020-06-20,1,Used to be delicious,0,0,We have loved this ice cream for a while and have bought many many pints. Ove the last couple of months I have bought it at different stores and we found some of these are horrible. The truffle pieces look nothing like the picture on this site or what they're supposed to look like. Unfortunately I threw them all away so I don't have one but they're little hard pieces of stale tasting chocolate bits. It ruins the ice cream and I was blaming the store thinking maybe they weren't kept frozen but I found the same thing when I purchased elsewhere. Not sure if it was a problem at the factory or if a change was made to the ice cream but wither way it ruins it and I can't keep wasting money on bad ice cream. I don't mind paying more for good quality but I'm not getting it anymore with this flavor and it's so disappointing.;;;
Chocolate Shake It,Missa,2018-08-18,5,Rich but subtle,0,0,I have had this flavor twice now and it has hit the spot each time. It's subtle but it has deep flavor. It's very much like biting into a chocolate milkshake. I could do without the marshmallow fluff but it does have a nice texture and it breaks up the heaviness of the ice cream. A lot of people are reviewing that this flavor is bland but I like it. I hope it continues to be an option for years to come because I will be buying a shameful quantity of pints.;;;
"Chocolate Shake It,violet616,2018-02-13,2,Great idea!,1,2,""I love a chocolate malt and loved the idea. While I found the ice cream itself to be delightfully creamy, the truffles certainly satisfying and marshmallow cream a pleasant addition I found the overall product to leave a strange aftertaste, so much so that I tossed out the pint after one paltry serving. Disappointing, but I intend to keep trying your new and novel flavors :)""";;;
"Chocolate Shake It,Isitdahfridge,2019-01-03,3,Is it the stores’ fault?,0,0,""I bought two pints of this flavor, each from a different store, and I was quite surprised. One was from a gas station, the other from a grocery store. The one from the gas station was grainy, but my guess it was just beginning to form ice crystals (maybe the door to their freezer room was slightly open). The one from the grocery store was perfectly smooth (other than the chunks).""";;;
"Chocolate Shake It,Jenniferu1,2020-06-23,4,Love this!,0,0,""I bought this today and couldnt wait to try it. I can definitely taste the malt in the ice cream. With the marshmallow it reminded me of a mallo cup candy, without the coconut, from years ago but way better as I'm not a fan of coconut. I just had a few bites tonight but plan on putting some hot fudge on it to make a sunday tomorrow and I'm sure it will taste like heaven! I eat in moderation!""";;;
"Chocolate Shake It,ChrisColby,2018-04-15,3,Good flavor but lacking.,0,1,""A strong malt chocolate base and the marshmallow swirl make for a good set up, but this flavor was really lacking in mix ins. The truffles in my pints were spaced too far apart and with too few in general. This flavor needed more of a bite or crunch (perhaps a second mix in, like cookie crumbs) to reach its full potential. A good flavor (thanks to the base and swirl) but certainly lacking""";;;
"Chocolate Shake It,duffy,2018-08-30,5,My new favorite,0,0,""In the past month I have bought a pint of this flavor every week. The texture is different to other flavors, more like a milkshake, which to me gives it some novelty and frankly I really like it. The chocolate cookie pieces alone are a little dry but pack great flavor and with the marshmallow swirls which are more liquid and the new texture it works together to make a truly great pint.""";;;
"Chocolate Shake It,SusanHop,2018-08-03,5,Fabulously delicious!,0,0,""I'm not a fan of marshmallow, but the chocolate malted milkshake ice cream, plus the truffle sold me on trying it.

The truffles are divine and blend the three ingredients into a satisfying and delicious ice cream experience.""";;;
"Chocolate Shake It,Joelle,2019-10-14,3,meh,0,0,""The ice cream itself is so good--malty chocolate, perfect. The marshmellow swirl is good and in good ratio but those fudge clusters!

If you are some one who loves chocolate and/or chocolate ice cream then you need to try this because this one does not disappoint. You will want to be multiple pints because one pint just won't be enough. I could easily eat pints and pints of this deliciousness in a single day and I am not exaggerating. It really is the best chocolate ice cream I have ever had. They could have aptly named this one Brownie Batter because it really tastes like frozen a brownie. This is for all of us chocoholics out there. Thank you, Ben and Jerry's and please never discontinue this flavor! You have shown the rest that you are the best when you created this flavor.""";;;

"Chocolate Therapy,Nicki237,2017-08-20,3,Decadent,2,26,""I just recently bought this at My local publix and wanted to try something new and picked this up. Very dense chocolatey icecream. Tastes like real chocolate compared to other ice creams but my problem with this is it should've had actual chocolate pudding swirls instead of pudding icecream and the cookies instead taste more like chocolate chips instead of cookies. The icecream also is more of a dark chocolate flavor, slightly bitter. Would've tasted much better if it was chocolate fudge icecream or Milk chocolate icecream but still a good icecream I just wouldn't buy it again""";;;

I was excited when this came out so I could mix it up a bit and give my tastebuds a chance to miss chocolate fudge brownie. I really like this one but I think the cookies weren't the right choice. I like the pudding ice cream so I think what would've been better would be like a ganache swirl or chocolate frosting. Chocolate cookies aren't very popular to begin with so it wasn't the selling point for me. I wanted to try the chocolate pudding ice cream. Still though it's a rich chocolate ice cream that I enjoy a lot;;;

I went to the scoop shops and they said it was discontinued, this was a few years ago. Well, I begrudgingly made peace with it a while ago. There was always that small voice in my head that said to check the freezer in my grocery store (this is over about 4 different states I've lived in), alas, no dice. Tonight, I have been reunited with my best ice cream best friend, I was at Walmart picking up a few things and that little voice said """"just look for it"""". So I did, and there it was. I stood there in pure amazement for a good minute. Never give up hope.""";;;
Chubby Hubby,ChubbyHubbysMainLady,2018-09-17,5,best ice cream ever!!! No joke,7,0,That if something happened to this flavor of ice cream I would die inside. This has easily become an addiction and I forewarn everyone who dares try it I've been on the hunt for it at every store near me trying to get the sellers nearest me to keep it in stock instead of only Cherry Garcia which I personally a peanut butter pretzel fudge loving person am not very fond of. If this ice cream Chubby Hubby was in fact a Chubby Hubby he would definitely be my hubby of choice. So a huge thank you to those coworkers the pranki. My only complaints are where and what is up with the Froyo version! Please attend issue as soon as possible;;;
"Chubby Hubby,FuzzyGut,2018-05-31,4,Very good pint,5,0,""I just had my first pint of Chubby Hubby and I thought it was great! The ice cream flavor is delicious. Since my first experience with this flavor was after the change from peanut butter filled pretzels to regular pretzels, I can’t speak to that (though the filled ones do sound great) but the chocolate covered pretzels in the new pints are great! The reason I am giving my review 4 and not 5 stars is because I didn’t get any chocolate peanut butter swirl until the very bottom of the pint. I can imagine that if it had been dispersed throughout, it would have been AMAZING! Still, I will get another of these in the future.""";;;

It appears that Ben & Jerry have changed their """"formula"""" for their classic Chubby Hubby flavor, and in doing so have made it far worse. The ice cream used to be fuller and creamier, with peanut-butter filled chocolate covered pretzels and scrumptious robust chunks/gobs of peanut butter. Indeed, quite decadent! Now the ice cream is more """"watery"""" (almost like skim milk), the pretzels are no longer filled with peanut butter, and the peanut butter is simply thinly swirled. The result: a pale comparison to its former self";" not as rich, not as tasty. Tastes very generic now. Skimping... a sign of the times... Will not be buying again.""";;

I've never before found an ice cream flavor I just didn't like (and my first job was selling ice cream, so I've tried a lot!). I wanted to love it, but after a few bites, I found one of the pretzels, and it was so salty! I thought it was a fluke, but I soon found another that was worse. It took a few minutes for the salt to dissolve in my mouth. Now I LOVE a sweet/salty combination, but I would have gotten less salt licking our Michigan winter roads.

They used to be peanut butter filled pretzel nuggets covered in chocolate - a crunchy triple delight! I no longer buy this ice cream. :-(""";;;
"Chubby Hubby,Julie,2018-02-19,5,-gurgling noise-,12,1,""I have a tough time finding this flavor, and thank goodness for that, because I find it impossible to put it down whenever I get it.

Chubby Hubby,samw98,2017-04-21,5,BEST FLAVOR,5,0,I had this flavor for the first time a few months ago after finally tracking it down and it's AMAZING. Definitely in my top 3 right behind Cinnamon Buns and Peanut Butter World. My pint had over 15 pretzels in it and I was very happy. Only suggestion would be to make the pretzels into peanut butter filled pretzels!;;;

There's just something MAGICAL about the formula of malt vanilla ice cream, with just the right amount of peanut butter and fudge swirling through, and the crunchy chocolate-covered pretzel nuggets embedded within---this combination is something close to ice cream heaven!!! Love digging into the pint, savoring the rich ice cream, and uncovering those awesome chocolate-covered pretzel nuggets---like mining for gold. Please, Ben & Jerry's, NEVER EVER discontinue this AMBROSIAL flavor!!!! And THANK YOU for providing me with such a great experience through your ice cream!!! :)))""";;;
"Chubby Hubby,Chubster,2020-04-22,5,Actually better than before.,1,0,""This is hands down my favorite ice cream on the planet. I guess I'm fortunate that I almost never find it in stores, because i can't see it without buying it. A lot of people have complained about the change from Chocolate covered peanutbutter FILLED pretzels to chocolate covered peanutbutter pretzels (it is my understanding that this was due to the original pretzels no longer being available to B&J's). While I do thing that the original was better in principal, I found that I frequently got pints where the pretzels were soggy and disappointing. I have never had that happen with the new recipe. The new pretzels are always crunch and a little bit saltier, which I actually prefer";" I need the salt to balance the fudge and vanilla malt. Still the best!""";;

Chubby Hubby,Mia Oxford,2018-07-02,2,Disappointing :(,1,0,Wanted to try this since it seemed like a popular classic flavor. Sorry to say it was disappointing to me. The pint I got contained mostly chewy pretzels instead of crunchy ones. It also seemed that there were peanut pieces that were chewy. I liked the crunchy but the chewiness was an odd texture.;;;

We just ate it and it wasn't the same. The pretzels are supposed to be filled with peanut butter, not coated. I personally couldn't taste the peanut butter at all and the pretzels were too chewy. We will probably not be biting this flavor ever again.""";;;
Chubby Hubby,uhhuhkayla,2018-02-24,4,it was the best,3,0,this was my favorite up until the pretzels were no longer filled. it gave the ice cream that soft texture nw it has too much crunch and will never be the same. still good but not great and can never find it anywhere lately;;;

So unfortunate.""";;;
Chubby Hubby,IceCreamCouple,2018-01-11,3,Amazing but still disappointed,3,3,My girlfriend and I thought this was our new favorite flavor (actually got on here to review how amazing it is) then we began reading other reviews only to realize the pretzels used to be filled with peanut butter. We now can’t stop thinking about how much better that would taste. It has ruined our night. We are the type to obsess over something like this.

This is the perfect food. I often go on extended diets, and they are almost bookended with a pint of Chubby Hubby. It's honestly one of the only things that keep me going in life. The crispiness and the saltiness of the pretzel, combined with the sweet and chewy peanut butter swirls. It's just incredible.""";;;

Only ice cream I will buy at the store for the past 6 years now I even got my family hooked on it as well. A lot of people are mentioning the pretzels, but I love the extra crunch. There is already a peanut butter swirl and a little peanut butter goes a long way since it is a strong flavor. Thank you for making this ice cream and please please please never get rid of it.""";;;
Chubby Hubby,Chubby Hubby and wife,2018-02-13,5,Couldn't ask for a better treat!,1,0,My husband and I have been buying this ice cream flavor for about 6 months now. We are obsessed with this flavor. Chubby Hubby ice cream is addicting. We're just disappointed it doesn't come in a bigger size than pint and the pretzels are no longer filled with pb. I love the chewy pretzels. It adds character to the ice cream!!! Thank you for this yummy delightful flavor!;;;
"Chubby Hubby,e4tami,2017-06-21,1,it's ALL hard dry pretzels,3,4,""Unbelievable that they changed the pretzels that used to be chocolate covered and chocolate filled and now they are plain, dry, with something they """"call"""" chocolate covering them but it's just brown lard and there are SO many of them, hardly any ice cream, of course because they are cheap compared to cream, that one cannot even scoop the ice cream because the scooper keeps kitting pretzels, like big rocks when digging in dirt.""";;;

"Chubby Hubby,Ob95,2017-09-25,1,Basically a pint of pretzels,3,3,""I was extremely disappointed with this flavor. It was almost impossible to eat because every bite was a chunk of pretzel.

"Chubby Hubby,WestTexSuz,2019-05-17,2,Just not the same...,0,0,""After not seeing this, my favorite flavor, for years, I was really excited when I saw it in the freezer section! Malted milk vanilla ice cream, peanut butter and fudge swirls and, the best part, chocolate covered, peanut butter filled, pretzels, Oh My. Unfortunately, the new rendition of this flavor is missing the peanut butter filled part of the pretzel which makes it just a dry chunk of pretzel covered in a thin layer of chocolate. It's OK but now where near as good as the original.""";;;
"Chubby Hubby,KimBeth,2020-02-23,3,Bring Back The Old,0,0,""This ice cream used to have more of an intense malt flavor--now the flavor of malt is lacking. The base of the ice cream used to be more like marbled fudge with thick swirls of peanut butter--now the base of the ice cream is vanilla with thin swirls of peanut butter and fudge. The pretzels used to be filled with peanut butter and covered with thick chocolate to keep the pretzels from losing texture--now the pretzels are not filled with peanut butter and the chocolate coating is not thick enough to prevent the pretzels from becoming soggy. I'm assuming the company did this to trim calories but if people want to be on a diet, we wouldn't be buying premium ice cream. Although this flavor is still good, it does not have the perfection it used to have years ago. Please go back to the original!!!""";;;

I know that the old pretzels sometimes got soggy but when they did not, the whole thing tated sublime. Now, the pretzels are huge lumps, crunchy but fairly tasteless and not stuffed with peanut butter. Plus, I almost always get one or two super super salty (as if I crunched a lump of salt) pretzels that ruin the whole experience. Do something to fix and save this amazing flavor!""";;;

I grew up drinking vanilla malt milkshakes with my dad and this ice cream base is perfectly that. I love the fudge swirls, they have a very classic chocolate syrup taste. They're not too overpowering! Always so many pretzels too! This ice cream is a no brainer for me. Team Chubby Hubby 5ever. <3""";;;
Chubby Hubby,Uncle Gingy,2020-01-14,3,Disappointing pretzel evolution,0,0,Grew up loving this ice cream. Rarely would get anything else. Was disappointed in The change from chocolate cover peanut butter FILLED pretzels to simply chocolate covered but was able to look the other way as the peanut butter swirl still meet my needs.

"Chunky Monkey,jwhgg7,2018-08-17,3,Great flavor but hardly any chocolate chips,2,0,""I was sad to give a mediocre rating because I really loved the flavor of this ice cream. I have never had banana ice cream before and B&J does it perfectly. The addition of walnuts and chocolate pieces makes this flavor simple but delicious. Maybe it was an isolated incident, but my pint had very few chocolate pieces. I think I was averaging 1 chocolate piece for every 4 scoops of ice cream. That's not great, especially since the image on the label shows it being riddled with chocolate. I am hoping this was an isolated incident and the next chunky monkey pint will be better.""";;;

My next go to, plain ol' vanilla was not available either. I decided to try something new, normally I'm not adventurous with my food. I decided on trying Chunky Monkey because I love bananas. I opened my pint a few nights later, took my first spoon full and there were no chocolate chunks and very little walnuts. I kept digging and nada. The ice cream was very tasty and smooth. The walnuts had a nice nutty toasted flavor. Still, no chocolate chunks. It wasn't until I got to the bottom of the pint a few nights later did I find THREE chocolate chunks. Not cool, not cool at all.""";;;

After the first few bites into the pint, I realized how gross the banana flavor in it is. This might just be me, but I did not like the flavor. Eating into it some more, I noticed a stinging in the back of my throat, I think because of the fudge pieces. It was an acidic sting the more I ate, and the worse it got the more I ate, so I ended up throwing away the pint soon after I started.""";;;

It's hard to choose the best part, but it is the chocolate chunks. After an intense amount of research I was unable to find what kind of chocolate was used in the ice cream. I would pay a lot of money to eat a chocolate bar made out of the kind of chocolate used in chunky monkey. So, as far as I'm concerned if you would like to keep my business you have two choices: 1. Add much more chocolate to pint of ice cream like advertised or 2. make chocolate bars. Thanks and have a great day.""";;;

Chunky Monkey,HayyHayy,2020-02-16,5,MY FAVORITE ICE CREAM EVER,0,0,Every time I go grocery shopping I buy 5 pints (which I go every week because I’m a college student) I wish I could buy more but I’m a broke college student. I go thru a pint every night. One day I walked to family dollar up the street because I thought they had it but they didn’t. After leaving family dollar I walked to multiple corner stores and they didn’t have it and they weren’t close either I was so depressed and sad when I went back to my dorm room. But I eat this ice cream almost every week. I just wanna say if you guys ever have a contest for a giveaway for this specific ice cream for months or a year I am entering and ima do everything to win! Love this ice cream out of all the Ben & Jerry ones ive had. I’ve even made my family start eating this one and one of my family members don’t even like bananas. Lol;;;
"Chunky Monkey,Marky Mark,2019-09-01,4,Surprisingly amazing flavor,1,0,""I am a chocoholic and will almost never buy any ice cream with any fruit associated with it but I decided to be open minded with this and give it a shot, so trust me when I say that this stuff is absolutely amazing. I was afraid that it was going to have a very strong banana flavor but it doesnt at all. It doesnt taste like a frozen banana or a banana smoothie or the artificial banana you see in popiscles and candy. Instead, the masterminds created a perfect harmony of sweet cream, vanilla, and banana that keeps it from being boring and the texture is out of this world, better than any soft serve i have ever had with it's creaminess and density. The only reason i am not giving this a 5 stars review is because i didnt care for the walnuts or the fudge chunks. They could have left them out completely and that would have been perfectly okay with me or have gone with milk chocolate chunks or peanut butter cups. Still, this ice cream is one of their best and one of the best i have ever had and i am shocked to say that about a fruit flavored ice cream. I was so impressed with the flavor that went out the next day to buy another pint. Now I know why it's a top seller year after year.""";;;

Drove to the store and could hardly wait to taste it when i got home and....... I was disappointed :( Although the cinnamon flavor was delicious and definitely there, the cinnamon bun dough pieces that other reviewers were raving about just weren't there for me. The dough was VERY dry and crumbly, NOT at all soft and gooey like others have claimed. Not sure if mine was a bad batch but unfortunately I was very disappointed.""";;;

It's fulfilled my love for cinnamon and is my favorite flavor in the world! As of March 2019, however...I never see it in my area. My college town and my hometown don't seem to sell it ANYWHERE! I actually cried on my mom's birthday over it, how embarrassing. It truly is the best ice cream in the entire world. I miss it so much.""";;;
"Cinnamon Buns,Thom,2018-06-26,1,Strange texture,2,1,""I ran to the store to try a new flavor and just opened a pint of this today and was disappointed in the quality of the buns dough... the dough tasted old and was too hard. I tried leaving it to sit out for a while to see if it had just needed to thaw a bit, but that did not do the trick, also there were big almost sugar cubes between the ice cream. :(""";;;

Cinnamon Buns,Durban,2019-03-01,3,Mostly good,1,0,I was super excited to stumble upon this flavor. It was delicious other than the cinnamon bun dough bites. The dough had a weird taste and after a few pieces i could only describe it as a black licorice flavor. I mostly picked out the dough pieces and was able to enjoy the rest of the ice cream!;;;

"Cinnamon Buns,SugarPlumVixen,2020-01-29,5,Model Of What All Cinnamon Ice Creams Should Be,0,0,""I've never thought that an ice cream would make me feel all warm and gooey and content inside but Ben & Jerry's decided otherwise. I bought this on a whim when my cinnamon loving mother was supposed to visit me but I ended up having to buy a second pint before she even got there. This ice cream has such a pronounced buttery cinnamon flavour to its base, and the dough remains just soft enough so that it really feels like you're biting into a chunk of the thick cinnamon rolls you get at the mall. The cinnamon streusel swirl was probably my favourite part though. My mom and I fought over who got to scoop their spoon through the biggest swirls. Just to note it, my first pint had a lot of swirl while my second had more dough. Both were delightful but I wish it would have been more consistent with more of both aspects please!""";;;

Is is loaded with chunks of cinnamon bun like dough. I don't know what it truly is but it is amazing!""";;;
"Cinnamon Buns,Alex576,2019-10-05,1,Super disappointing,1,2,""Not what you'd expect from Ben and Jerry's. If I didn't know better if think it was some cheap store brand. The """"gobs"""" of cinnamon roll dough are just those weird sugary chunks like in cheap cookie dough ice cream. Not like any of the other dough in Ben and Jerry's ice cream. I took a few bites and it sat in the freezer for months until we threw it out.""";;;
"Cinnamon Buns,DC24,2018-09-04,1,Not This One!,1,1,""Just not enough contrast in this flavor. It simply fails to capture the essence of a delicious cinnamon roll.

Coffee Coffee BuzzBuzzBuzz!,,2020-09-21,5,The GOAT of coffee ice cream,3,0,I’ve tried all of the coffee flavored ice cream I can find in local stores and this one is easily the best. My only issue is that’s it’s not carried at many stores and I’ve had trouble finding it in the last month. Thankfully the B&J team assured me it’s not discontinued but the production is behind because of the pandemic. When things are back to normal please get this in more stores so more people will discover this incredibly indulgent and amazing treat!;;;

Coffee Coffee BuzzBuzzBuzz!,luna09,2017-08-31,5,Simply the best!,3,0,I adore this flavor. I have become quite a fan of stronger coffee over the years so this one is a winner. The coffee ice cream is definitely strong and just sweet enough. The espresso fudge pieces give a nice texture contrast and are a lot like eating chocolate covered espresso beans. Fortunately there are at least a couple stores in my area that have this one and I hope they never stop carrying it. Please never discontinue this flavor.;;;

Coffee Coffee BuzzBuzzBuzz!,DR725,2018-03-01,5,Absolute All Time FAVORITE FLAVOR!!,2,0,I am literally addicted to this flavor!! I love it!! It’s the best coffee flavored ice cream ever. I know I sound like I’m exaggerating but I honestly mean every word. I buy at least 2 pints every weekend for my cheat meals. Eat like half a pint for the weekend nights. I’ve tried so many other coffee flavors because it’s one of my favorites but this one tops them all the strength of the coffee flavor is the best it doesn’t have that weird too creamy taste it’s just like adding some milk and sugar to a cup of espresso and a side of some dark chocolate which is honestly the best flavor combo ever just pairs so well. And I love the dark chocolate espresso pieces; I used to buy dark chocolate covered espresso beans and eat them and it reminds me of that with the light crunchy-ness of the beans in the chocolate. My literal worst fear is that I go to my grocery store one of these fridays and I find out that this flavor has been pulled or discontinued! If this flavor ever got taken away that would be the worst ever!! I mean I think I buy out this flavor at my store alone and waiting for it to get shipped sucks and is a pain. This is a lot just for a flavor of ice cream but as I said before I love it and I’m addicted to it. It’s the only coffee flavor ice cream I’ll buy. Thank for making it!!;;

Coffee Coffee BuzzBuzzBuzz!,Lynda with a y,2020-02-22,3,Disappointed,0,1,I was so sad when my favorite coffee Heath bar crunch was replaced by toffee heath bar crunch. It is a total loss of flavor profiles - especially the change to the coffee base.

On a nearly 90 degree day here in NH, I decided to indulge. What a horrible disappointment. The ice cream is ok, but after a few bites of toffee, I was done and tossed the pint. I found myself avoiding the crunch. So disappointing. I appreciate your dedication to non GMO, but I prefer strong labeling. I am a big girl, and can make my own choices. I just won't bother with B&J's if they sacrifice taste. This is not health food, there is no way this variant is any better for you than the Heath version, let's not kid ourselves.""";;;
Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,Eliza,2019-10-28,1,Why isn’t Ben & Jerry’s listening to its consumers,45,15,After you changed the formula and removed heath bars from this ice cream it’s tasted awful. I ate this ice cream every day for years when it was Coffee Heath Bar Crunch. This new Coffee Toffee Crunch is dreadful. Consumers have been complaining since you made the change and you have not improved the ice cream. I know how Business works so I am sure part of the problem is that you are lock into a contract with the new Toffee company but you are losing sales therefore you should get a new supplier. I keep waiting and checking for you to fix this formula so it could taste like it used to. Very disappointed.;;;

And yes, I’ve read the multiple replies from B&J staff stating this flavor was not meant to replace it, but as others have pointed out, there is a video on the flavor’s page announcing its ‘new name’. I’ve bought this flavor more than once since its switch years ago, hoping for improvement over time, but still the toffee leaves a terrible aftertaste and the coffee ice cream lacks its once creamy, rich flavor. Ben & Jerry’s commitment to non-GMO products is admirable but please don’t this sacrifice the taste! Bring back the Heath Bar or give us a better replacement!""";;;
"Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,Jeremy,2018-05-10,1,My favorite snack is no more.,38,6,""I eat a relatively healthy diet and the coffee/toffee Ben and Jerry's was always my one real guilty pleasure that I would indulge in whenever I wanted something sweet. I admire the company's dedication to non-GMO/fair-trade products as I often eat a diet as low in non-GMO products as I can, but this new product really is dreadful. There is little flavor in the ice cream, and the toffee tastes like what you would expect from a sugar-free candy bar. I have bought it twice now, the first time was a surprise, and the second time was me hoping it was just an isolated mistake. Both were bad enough that I threw them away within a few bites. Major disappointment and I hope they take these reviews to heart and reconsider the product change.""";;;

I decided to try the new product because I figured it wouldn’t be too much different from the original. I can’t pretend to eat it. Knowing what the flavor was to this?! No comparison. I read all of the responses from Ben and Jerry’s on this site and they claim that the point was to not replace the product. If it wasn’t to replace why was Coffee Heath Bar crunch discontinued? Have the Non-GMO (I mean, we’re talking about a treat here) and the original one if it wasn’t meant to be a replacement. I haven’t bought a Ben and Jerry’s product since and I used to have my freezer full. Such a disappointment.""";;;

It's no longer rich, the toffee no longer produces that sticky liquidy toffee pool. Instead, this toffee melts into a pretty gross dark brown grainy mess. The left over flavor is just yucky.

I love coffee ice cream and I love toffee, so I thought the two together would be a great mix. Sadly, the coffee flavor was very weak, and the toffee tasted almost metallicy. I thought maybe it was just a bad bite, but every piece of toffee had that same metallic taste, and all of the ice cream that touched the toffee was given that flavor as well. Overall, I was highly disappointed, and very saddened because this was the first flavor I have tried that I did not like. I will be throwing away my pint and not buying this flavor again.""";;;

Today was a test to see if maybe had gone back to Heath Bar toffee. NOT. Whatever kind of toffee being used now is, apparently lots less money is the usual reason for change...big mistake. The Heath Bar version, I am betting, far outsold the present blend. The present toffee blend...we did not eat much of the pint, maybe total 3 spoonfulls. The rest...we tossed into trash.""";;;

Knowing that it isn't out there anymore is sad in a way the surprises me. And it's not like an old Atari you can find on eBay. It's just... gone. I didn't hear about the change but noticed it was really hard to find the flavor when I was looking for it. Then I found the Coffee Toffee Crunch and thought they might have just changed the name. Then I tasted it and thought I must have gotten a bad pint. Then I read the label and realized my favorite flavor was gone. I can only hope someday they'll bring it back.

I threw in the extra recognition because the idea is amazing. I was fortunate enough to try the original with Heath, but sometimes I wish I never knew how heavenly it was. It hurts so much to lose my favorite ice cream flavor strictly due to an ingredient change. The toffee is mediocre and reminds me of the cheap caramel from my childhood. It’s a critical difference from the original, more buttery and crunchy delight. Please, for my sanity, bring back the original flavor or just put this flavor to rest. I can’t take any more disappointment when I see it next to my second favorite flavor, skipping this one every time...""";;;

I get the whole non-GMO thing, but is there no one making a decent non-GMO toffee bar that you could use? One bite and I knew it wasn't Heath - though I hadn't heard you were making a change. I complained pretty vocally so my sister actually showed me the container to prove it wasn't a generic brand. It was then that I noticed the change in the name. I wish I had known. What a waste!

"Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,William Q,2018-02-01,5,BEST FLAVOR EVER!!!,5,4,""I can't believe I am seeing these negative review's. I am a fan of ice cream in general. I live in Schenectady NY and if anyone doesn't know this where some of the best ice cream in the country comes from. That said... This is my absolute FAVORITE flavor of all time. Awesome flavors. Together! But it is hard to find now and there's similar flavors out there but none with big chunks of toffee in it! Plus the coffee flavor compliments the toffee so well. I usually stick to my local brands, but this is by far one of the best out there!!! Why can't I find it anywhere guys!?""";;;
"Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,Michael,2017-10-10,1,Go To The Graveyard Already!,6,1,""After being a huge fan of the CHBC, I was quite upset when the new flavor came out and still am. The coffee ice cream and toffee bar is absolutely disgusting. The toffee doesn't have the flavor that Heath Bar or Skor does, and the coffee ice cream is also horrible. I asked somebody else to try this flavor after it changed and they also thought it was disgusting.""";;;
Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,Pamela56,2020-01-30,5,It says what it is. Great title,2,1,This is my favorite Ben & Jerry's flavor. I have had trouble finding it in my location 65109 and 65101. I love the coffee flavor with the flavor of the heath bar and the crunch of this ice cream. I am gluten free and so may flavors have cookie dough which automatically eliminates those options. Love this ice cream. Please start delivering this back to the zip code locations of 65101 and 65109. I have not been able to find this flavor in Jefferson City. Miss this ice cream which is what prompted me to make this review. Love the ice cream flavor of Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch.;;;
"Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,Juliennes,2018-02-27,1,What a disappointment....,4,2,""I don't eat a lot of ice cream in order to try and avoid too much sugar. But I wanted a treat and Coffee Heath Bar has always been my favorite ice cream. I picked up a pint and was so looking forward to the indulgence. What an absolute disappointment it was. I originally thought it was me...maybe I had dreamed it up in my head that it had tasted better than it did in reality. I had some more the next day and it still was not good. I had my son try some and he agreed. I was not going crazy. The toffee pieces are just awful. I am all for the non-GMO movement but honest to God, I would gladly take the Heath Bars back regardless. It was a delicious treat that is now a huge let down. I truly hope that I can find some replacement :(""";;;

"Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,Madelyn,2018-10-09,1,Yuck!,2,0,""I wish I had read the reviews, this ice cream is digusting! I love Ben and Jerry’s and like to try new flavors but this was a huge let down. The ice cream has little flavor and the toffee is indescribably bad. Like other reviewers said it tastes metallic and like a sugar free candy. The texture is grainy unlike other Ben and Jerry’s ice creams. I was wondering if I got a weird pint until I read the other reviews. I threw the pint away it, it was inedible. I expect more from Ben and Jerry’s especially at $5/pint.""";;;

I used to do it all the time in my own kitchen, and I liked mine just as much as I like Heath bars. Please find a supplier of non-GMO toffee that doesn’t taste like a nickel-cadmium battery. Geez, maybe I’ll start up my own toffee company and underbid whomever you’ve contracted with just to save my formerly favorite ice cream flavor. (Well, second favorite of all time after Dastardly Mash — yeah, I go back that far.)""";;;
"Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,Susan,2019-06-04,5,Delicious,13,5,""This is my favourite flavour of Ben and Jerry's. The contrast between the rich coffee ice cream and the sweet crunchy toffee is lovely.

I could and do make better toffee in my kitchen. This was a bottomline decision. GMO, Fair Trade blah...blah, blah...blah, blah. Ruining one of the best BnJ's flavors was a bottomline decision by the parent company, Unilever. If BnJ's was purchased by Hershey, Heath bars would still be in use.""";;;
Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,Theresa,2018-10-07,1,Sucks,4,0,I used to love your coffee heath bar ice cream. But then you took away the heath and put in cheap toffee. Yuck!!!

Upon trying this changed version, I was so repulsed by the new toffee that I feel like I can no buy B&J's in the hopes that hear us on this particular flavor. I can at some level understand switching away from Heath Bars but there's plenty of ways to get a decent tasting non-Heath substitute (I've had a lot of good toffee in my time). But with this version it's like they're trying to make the worst toffee possible. B&J's product people please please please hear us!!! :(""";;;

The crunchy, crispy toffee pieces laced in fudge was heavenly. I just have to close my eyes and enjoy everytime a piece of toffee gets in my mouth. How this flavour got such low stars is something I would never understand in this lifetime. Mum’s a huge fan of coffee icecream and she just can’t stop raving about it. For sure this flavour is something we’ll keep coming back to. It’s like the gold standard of all coffee icecreams that exist in this world. Thanks a ton B&J.❤️""";;;

I'm not a coffee drinker, but what the hey? Boy, I really like this ice cream! The toffee pieces are much bigger than I expected, and that's a plus! I read some reviews from people who enjoyed the Heath bar version, but not this one. I'm sorry they don't like it, but I think it tastes great. Thanks, Ben and Jerry and the ice cream team!""";;;

Only one problem: I can never find it near me!!! The stores that are listed to carry this flavor never have it in stock, and now my poor husband is enslaved to finding it at all costs hahah!

I've seen a lot of criticism about the toffee in this but I LOVE it. It's better than heath or skor in my opinion. It's much crunchier and it has more of a buttery taste. Every time I eat this ice cream I wish that I could buy the toffee itself to snack on, Maybe Ben & jerry's could start making candy too?!""";;;
"Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,COMtnMama,2018-04-10,5,Coffee & Toffee deliciousness,5,2,""This flavor is just so delightful.

"Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,Former fan,2020-09-09,1,Still so disappointing,1,0,""Coffee Heath Bar used to be my absolute favorite ice cream and for years I bought it to the exclusion of everything else. Since the formula changed I've tried the """"new flavor"""" (I get it, """"not a replacement"""", sure) a few times and am always SO DISAPPOINTED. The toffee has a weird plastic-y texture and metallic aftertaste. This all natural non-GMO toffee tastes more fake than the good old Heath Bars ever did. And still missing is the absolute best part of the old flavor - the way the Heath Bars would melt a little into the ice cream leaving delicious gooey envelopes around the crunchy candy pieces.

I too loved Coffee Heath Bar Crunch, but this is a totally different product and I love it just as much. If you love toffee and coffee flavors, I think you'll enjoy this pint as much as I do. Just don't go in expecting Heath! This toffee reminds me more of a rich, handcrafted chocolate-covered toffee bar you'd find at a local chocolatiers shop. And it is so dang good.""";;;

The coffee flavor of the ice cream is rich and deep, the toffee pieces are huge, and although they are not Heath bars, the Toffee is incredible. It does have a slight molasses taste to it, which is why I think people are saying that it tastes burnt. It doesn't! I am so glad they made my favorite flavor even better!""";;;

I adore the toffee bar. Better than any I've had before! I'm eating it as we speak. Thank you! I also LOOOVE the big chunks!!!;;;
"Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,Anna,2018-01-19,2,Unreasonably large and mediocre toffee,2,2,""I miss the Heath bars for sure (I saw a response to one of the reviews saying that this wasn't meant to be a replacement, and people just aren't that dumb). But I could get over it, I still like the coffee flavor. But why are the toffee bar pieces so enormous? What am I supposed to do with an inch-long chunk of toffee in the middle of my ice cream? Chisel away at it with my spoon? Not a good experience, and it's happened in all of the last few pints I've bought.""";;;
"Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,BabyDaddy,2020-08-11,1,Pregnant wife is upset,1,0,""My wife loved the original flavor. She always said, whens she's pregnant she is going to eat this all the time. Well she got pregnant and there was no more coffee heath bar crunch. It crushed her spirits. Thankfully our local ice cream shop supported us through the pregnancy but the business would have been given to Ben and Jerry. Please bring back the CHBC flavor before we go through another pregnancy.""";;;
"Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,rockinbaker,2020-06-22,5,Favorite Flavor,1,0,""This is my absolute favorite Ben & Jerry's flavor! I used to get it all the time, but the stores I went to frequently all stopped carrying it around the same time. I assumed it was discontinued. Imagine my surprise when I moved to NC, and there are actual Ben & Jerry's shops, and this flavor still exists! So excited to get Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch again after years of flavors that just weren't the same.""";;;
"Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,Brenda,2017-11-01,1,Not good,1,0,""I was very disappointed after eating the new version of the toffey coffee heath ice cream. It was by far the worst I've ever eaten. The ice cream with the heath bar in it is my favorite. I will no longer buy it due to the drastic flavor of the new toffee. Most people aren't buying ice cream at Ben and Jerry prices for their health, it's usually to indulge a little bit. So sad to see the change.""";;;
"Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,The flying sergeant,2017-05-24,1,My life's blood ruined,4,2,""Ben & Jerry's Coffee Heathbar crunch has been my favorite food of all for about 26 years. I no kidding had days where it was all i ate. When i was a paramedic in Williamsburg, VA there was a B&J's store where you made the best even better by being in sundae form, heaven it was! In the military, anywhere in the world I was if I could find some of this ice cream I felt at home. Now however, it's not the same. The removal of actual heath bars completely changed the taste. Gone are the treasure which was the little gooey pockets found next to a piece of Heath. I hate to say it, but it actually tastes bad. Didn't know it was possible for a B&J ice cream to taste bad but it does. The chocolate tastes cheap like cheap generic store brand and the toffee tastes & feels stale.""";;;
Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,Cricket68,2017-07-05,1,July 4th bummer,2,1,I always buy coffee ice cream. I usually buy a pint of coffee/toffee at the nearby coop. The price is 9.99. My husband treated me to your Coffee a Toffee Crunch. The ice cream tasted like molasses. The toffee bits had no crunch and tasted stale. I tried it twice thinking I ate something earlier that would alter the taste. Second spoonful hours later still tasted like molasses.;;;
Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,jesslu,2017-07-25,5,Favorite Ice Cream...and I eat a lot of ice cream.,3,1,I'm shocked by the reviews of this ice cream. It's not the strongest coffee flavored I've ever had but when paired with the delicious and generously sized pieces of toffee it is fabulous.;;;
Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,Patti,2017-06-20,5,Dad's favorite,3,1,This was my dad's favorite and I like it a lot too. He walked me down the aisle for my wedding in 1996 and his reward was a pint. I can't believe people aren't reviewing it higher.;;;
Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,Bonne,2017-06-28,5,Awesome!,3,1,I love this ice-cream!! I'm from Canada and it also appears that my fav grocery stores have stopped stocking this one. I hope it hasn't been discontinued in the Great White North.;;;
"Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,Rufus,2018-11-15,1,Toffee pieces too large,1,0,""I like coffee ice cream. I like toffee. What could go wrong?? Ahh! That's right. The toffee pieces are too large, so large it's difficult to get a little toffee and a little coffee ice cream in the same bite. Too bad because toffee & and coffee go together like two peas in a pod.""";;;
Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,CTisthebest,2017-10-05,5,My favorite!,3,2,All the negative reviews are crazy. This is my favorite flavor by far! I love the giant chunks or crunchy toffee. No other ice cream maker has anything even remotely close. You're lucky if you get tiny slivers in other brands. My only regret is that it seems to be caffeinated so I can't eat it too late or it keeps me awake.;;;
Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,Allieb,2018-03-26,5,BEST FLAVOR,3,1,Hands down the absolute best flavor made! No other coffee flavor even comes close! The toffee chunks are HUGE and the coffee flavor itself can’t be beat!!!;;;
"Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,maerceci,2018-04-15,5,Surprisingly Awesome!,2,1,""I wasn't too sure on this flavor, but my local store at them BOGO half off, so since they were sold out on Strawberry Cheesecake, I though I would try something new. And I found it to be one of my new favorite flavors. I love that the toffee doesn't get stuck in your teeth like a regular toffee candy bar, and the coffee ice cream compliments it perfectly.""";;;
"Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,Jaze,2020-02-11,5,Best Ice Cream I EVER Had!,1,0,""This is the only ice cream im willing to eat. For everyone that doesnt like this ice cream your negative reviews has made it difficult for people like me who would like to find it at the grocery store. im on a ben and jerrys coffee heath bar crunch ice cream hunt and i cant find it. The gas station nearby was the only place i could find it for 6.99 and now they have discontinued it After reading these negative reviews now i see why its slowly disappearing from stores. it is absolutely the best ice cream on the market. my 2 favorite things combined coffee and heath make it easily my favorite ice cream. I would pay $100 to have a bucket in front of me right now, but it is like a mission to find it. i live by smiths in las vegas they dont have it, walmart doesnt have it, some albertsons may have it i think if im lucky but i havent seen it on this side of town since i moved. no ice cream compares to this one. i hope to find a store soon with it. <3""";;;
"Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,Julie11,2017-05-09,1,Not the best,3,2,""I thought I'd really enjoy this flavor, like I do with all other flavors or b&j, but this one just doesn't taste good. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I was excited to try it, but was very disappointed once I got home only to have it sitting in my freezer ever since.""";;;
Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,Kelly,2017-04-30,3,Just alright,2,1,I have always had a thing for this flavor and finding it around my area is hard. I recently stumbled upon it and was so excited to get home and take a bite. Not realizing they changed the heath bar to a toffy bar I knew something was different : (... I want the heath bar back!!! It's just not the same without it.;;;

I hadn't bought this product in a while and didn't realize till I bit into one of the toffee pieces that it was no longer made with Heath bars. I understand their reasoning behind changing the toffee pieces, but this toffee is horrible. Tasted old and very oily. So sad!""";;;
"Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,BJRCallahan,2019-10-10,1,""Once my wife’s favorite, now unpalatable."",1,0,My wife loved this back when it used Heath bars but now she cannot stand it. The toffee no longer compliments the whole. Thankfully Americone Dream is unchanged so she still has an option she enjoys. I understand this B&J goal but flavor is still the most important consideration when it comes to ice cream.";;;
"Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,Lilasiris,2020-05-21,5,Tastes great!,1,0,""This has always been my favorite flavor from Ben & Jerry’s, but it’s hard to find. I enjoyed it with Heath, but this new toffee is much better! It’s more buttery and easier to eat frozen. It tastes like the more expensive English toffee they sell in tins during Christmas.""";;;
Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,Erica,2018-04-22,2,Dislike the new recipie ...,2,1,This used to be one of my favorite flavors. Bought it today and didn't notice the name change. The bars have a gritty texture to them and is nothing like the Heath bars that were used. Disappointed. Really wish I didn't choose this flavor. Won't purchase again.;;;
Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,Pepper,2020-01-23,1,Everything is a disappointment!,1,0,Are used to love CHBC far that I’ve changed wouldn’t be that different. Boy was I wrong! The coffee flavour is so disappointing and the bar is granny with no nice coffee flavour I am so sad as this used to be a big treat for me and now I’ve had to waste a pint.;;;
"Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,Rgdedge,2018-07-08,1,Ruined,0,0,""I’m so disappointed. I loved Coffee Heath Bar Crunch. I picked this up, assuming it was a slight retool with a new, generic, toffee bar. It’s just not good. The texture of the ice cream is icy, not creamy, and the toffee bars are crumbly and one-note: sickly sweet. They remind me a bit of Scottish tablet. 3/4 of a pint still in the freezer and I don’t think I’ll be finishing it. I should’ve known...same disappointment when Mint Oreo changed to Mint “Cookie”. The essence gets lost in the translation.""";;;
Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,Mom of four,2018-11-04,1,Terrible substitute,1,0,This is the worst thing you could have done to my most favorite flavor of ice cream ever!! This version doesn’t even come close in comparison to Coffee Heath Bar Crunch!!! Please bring back the original...this Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch stuff is awful!!!;;;
Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,Pixie,2017-07-01,5,CoffeeToffeeBestComboEver! - SorryPB&chocolate!,2,1,I found this flavor many years ago when it had Health Bar and I was sad at first when the toffee changed but I have learned to love the responsibly sourced toffee too. I like to try other B&J flavors but Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch is my true love!;;;
Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,Shay04,2017-05-14,1,Used to be good,1,0,This used to be my favorite ice cream.

Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,hmtj,2019-06-17,1,Toffe is horrible,1,0,Just tried this in desperation looking for my Coffee Heath Bar Crunch fix. What a mistake. The toffee is chalky. Horrible flavor. Can't compare to the Heath Bars they used before. Don't waste your money. Grab another flavor.;;;
"Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,Lori,2017-05-28,2,Different Toffee Bars,1,1,""My favorite Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream Flavor has always been Coffee Toffee Crunch, but the Toffee bars have changed. I think you used to use Heath Bars which are buttery and delicious and what a great combination to the coffee ice cream, but now the Toffee bars taste blah and I don't care for them in the ice cream. It makes the ice cream taste watery instead of buttery. Wish you would go back to the original recipe.""";;;
Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,steph22002,2017-09-18,1,Bad taste,1,0,i bought this flavor ice cream today. Its my first buy from the brand. I was ready to dig in. I was disappointed at the flavor. The coffee taste watered down. Not a rich flavor. The toffee taste odd. I didn't enjoy it.;;;
"Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,BJLUVER,2017-06-14,4,Good ice cream with a bad wrap,1,3,""Now I wanna clear some things up here. This isn't a bad flavor but it seems as though it's getting a bad wrap. What a lot of people won't tell you about ice cream indulgence is that the mood/setting/amount you consume/way you consume all affect the experience. So let me start off by saying if you set out to finish the pint, you might not like this flavor, and that's fine, but just know you didn't enjoy this ice cream the way it was intended to be enjoyed. This is for the people who enjoy small servings of sweets. For those with more mature palettes. This ice cream deserves appreciation and admiration, and I believe the consumer but question where they're at mentally and spiritually before imbibing. Are there better flavors? Of course. But it's all about the time, place, feeling, and mode/way of consumption. This is enjoyable.""";;;
Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,SSue12,2017-09-03,2,It used to be amazing,1,1,I bought this about 1-2 years ago under the Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch name. It had pools of the tasty toffee throughout and the crunch bars also had lots of the gooey stuff. The coffee base was smooth and rich.;;;

Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,Ice cream machine,2018-07-24,1,Greatest Canadian Loss,1,0,I'm not sure I have ever been so sad as when this flavour was removed from Canadian shelves. It is my favourite flavour but I can't travel to the US just for ice cream. A nation has been deprived.;;;

Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch,Mom2017,2017-05-01,2,Don't like the new toffee,2,1,I loved coffee Heath bar crunch but this new flavor is nothing like it. Toffee tastes bad and barely a coffee flavor to the ice cream. I'll probably toss it out. Liked the old flavor better.;;;

I used to love the coffee heath bar crunch as well, but to me, this one is so similar, I don't see why so many are disappointed?

When B&J switched, I investigated as thorough as a consumer could. I discovered it had something to do with the Hershey's corp, and B&J had to come up with a toffee tasting replacement. So I gave it a try. It took a few pints, but I grew to love Coffee-Toffee as much as the Heath Bar Crunch. Its a little different, but it is good in its own way. This is the only food I've ever found that I can eat once a day and never get tired of it. I've probably eaten about 4,000 pints of the Coffee-Toffee (on top of probably 2,000 pints of the Heath). Sometimes, I get a pint that doesn't have quite as much of the toffee candy in it, so I buy a bag of the Heath """"Bit-o-Brickle"""" Cookie bits, and sprinkle some on top, and it supplements the toffee nicely. Sometimes, I sprinkle in some Heath bits regardless of how much toffee is in the pint. I can't help it.""";;;

Cold Brew Caramel Latte,BrianNYC,2020-07-30,5,Finally an ice(cream) caramel latte!,1,0,I bought this flavor a couple of weeks ago and it has now become my all time favorite ice cream! If you love coffee ice creams and caramel this is the perfect ice cream for you! Mixing the cold brew ice cream with sweet cream allows for a much more subtle coffee flavor and really emphasizes the trio of flavors goes together exceptionally well.;;;

"Cold Brew Caramel Latte,drewwwtimus,2020-09-22,5,Amazing & Satisfying!,0,0,""To say I love ice cream is an understatement. I eat a pint of Ben & Jerry's every night (that is not a typo). I usually do half baked and try other """"exclusive"""" flavors when I need a change. I saw this flavor at 7-11 and decided to try it. Wow! This is my new favorite flavor! It tastes like genuine cold-brew coffee, not a cheap, overly sweet imitation. The sweet creme ice cream gives the perfect amount of sweetness without being too much. And the slightly salted caramel swirls are to die for. The combination of flavors is the perfect balance. It's not too sweet or heavy and is actually refreshing. There's no chunks, so if you love creamy ice cream like me give this flavor a try! Tastes just like that popular chain's caramel frappuccino. Only problem is that I bought every one at my 7-11 and can't find any more! I'm absolutely in love with and addicted to this flavor and hope it becomes a staple.""";;;

I love Ben and Jerry’s, this flavor was the only one left at 7-11..... about four bites fixed my sweats craving, however- despite my love for coffee and my love for icecream - this just doesn’t taste quite right.

However when you changed the recipe and took the HEATH out of it I noticed immediately! I thought I had bought a bad batch, and after a few bites threw it away. After 4 more batches with the same disgusting taste, I wondered why I was eating ice cream that tasted like rusty metal! And sure enough it was the NEW “Toffee Pieces”. They are so bad I can no longer eat this. What a tremendous disappointment. I could eat another brand of ice cream with a rusty spoon and it would taste less like metal than the New everything but the.....NEVER AGAIN!""";;;

I fell in love with it the first time I had it, it was packed full of peanut butter cups and huge pieces of toffee. However the past couple time I've had it I only get shavings of toffee, and a couple peanut butter cups. was there a recipe change? Smaller toffee and more nuts? Fewer PB cups?

While I do love pb cups, I wanted more of a variety in this ice cream. I only got two pieces of the toffee and less than 5 almonds. The white chocolate was there which was delicious but my favorite is the toffee and unfortunately it was lacking. Overall, it’s good if you’re in the mood for peanut butter cups.""";;;
Everything But The...,Kokoabuttah,2020-07-14,4,Pregnant go to,0,0,I bought this ice cream honestly because the supermarket was having a sale and they didn’t have the kind I originally wanted no brand shall be named being that I’m 38 weeks pregnant and can never make my mind up on what I want the list of ingredients sounded like a delicious combination of everything I wanted to try so I bought one.

Once I did, I had to spit it out in the sink. The chocolate, vanilla, and almonds are good, but the toffee covered fudge chunks tasted nothing like hoe they sound. They tasted like blood or rusty metal. Yuck! I thought I could just work my way around the blood tasting fudge pieces, but no, the metallic flavor was everywhere!

"Everything But The...,kleemargaret,2018-09-02,3,Not the Same,1,1,""5 years ago, Everything But The was my favorite treat. I ate a pint a week and I was in love. Then, one day, I opened a new pint of the ice cream and found that the Heath Bar part tasted a little funky. I thought at the time that I got a bad batch of the ice cream and bought a new one. Sadly, I realized that there had been a switch of the Heath Bar permanently. For the past 5 years, I have eaten around the metallic tasting toffee. I still love the flavor, but I beg that we can switch back to the original taste.""";;;
"Everything But The...,prospermom,2019-04-05,3,Please use better TOFFEE!,1,0,""This was my favorite ice cream in the whole world (five stars!) UNTIL the """"new"""" toffee. From the other reviews I read, I know your other fans agree with me. And of course this applies to all your other flavors that have Toffee as well, that I USED to enjoy, like Coffee Heath Bar. I appreciate the Non_GMO/Fairtrade efforts, but can you please source Toffee that meets your standards and actually tastes good? The toffee is missing the buttery taste. Or maybe gets Hershey's on board with making some special non GMO Toffee just for you guys? I used to love digging for """"treasure"""": the gooey, slightly melted toffee pockets were my favorite part. Now, I don't buy this ice cream nearly as much as I used to, but when I do, I dig around the toffee and throw it away, which is wasteful. I cant just add Heath bars to this myself because they will not get those gooey carmelly toffee pockets.""";;;

I like to try a new flavor every time. The description of this flavor sounded to die for, so I snagged a pint. However, I'm very disappointed in the flavor of the candy chunks. The white """"fudge"""" tastes like plastic or has some sort of chemical aftertaste and the toffee pieces taste metallic/rusty.

Glampfire Trail Mix,tortellini,2018-04-03,5,Delicious Swirls,3,0,The regular chocolate ice cream usually isn't the best but the salty pretzel swirly really elevates it to a new place. The combination creates a salted chocolate flavor that really keeps you coming back for more. Marshmallow swirls are always a good option over mini marshmallows and the almonds add a good crunch. I rounded this up to 5 stars but I would be interested in graham cracker or some type of pastry chunks along with or replacing the almonds. I just simply don't love almonds. Overall 4.5/5 Very good.

The real problem was that the pint wasn’t full! There was a big gap on the side of the container and that was rather frustrating.

And it would be 10 out of 10 except the pretzel part is waaay too salty. if it were actual pretzel pieces it would be ok too But in the container I got, the pretzel part was like the texture of wet sand and just too salty. Zero crunch at all and no defined pieces. just this salty paste. But the chocolate, marshmallows and almonds are so good. I'm wondering If I got a bad container because reading other people's reviews of this flavor, they had pretzel pieces in theirs. which would have been 10x better.""";;;

The salty swirls are so delicious and the marshmallow took the show! I would have given this a 5 out of 5 based on that. But purchasing it again, it was basically chocolate ice cream with marshmallow. The pretzel swirls was NOT in my pint. Very disappointed in the hit or miss with the pints. I thought they was improving on this but that’s the second pint of this flavor with the skimpy mix ins. I get so disappointed when this happens being I only indulge once a week in ice cream so I want it to be good! Please work on this.""";;;

"Glampfire Trail Mix,ChrisColby,2020-03-05,3,Rocky Road-ish?,1,0,""Glampfire Trail Mix has chocolate ice cream with chocolate covered almonds, a marsmallow swirl, and a pretzel swirl. The base and almonds provide alot of chocolate flavor that dominates the taste buds when eaten in isolation. The salty pretzel swirl gives a nice crunch and heightens the chocolate, giving it a sort of dark chocolate taste. It's a little overbearing but luckily the sweet marshmallow swirl balances the other components out, providing a great flavor when eaten as a whole. Very close in fact to a rocky road but done better. The only problem is the amount of marshmallow isn't enough. Perhaps I just got a pint with less marshmallow but without more of it, the salty chocolate taste can be overpowering. A great flavor when all the components come together but a little too strong on the chocolate taste otherwise.""";;;
"Glampfire Trail Mix,NanasCone,2019-09-15,5,Might be my new favorite!,1,0,""Just picked up this pint today, and was blown away by how deliciously rich, textured, and addictive this flavor is. I loved the chocolate covered almonds, the rich chocolate icecream, against the gooey marshmallow, and the nicely salty graham cracker. I am no fan of those cloyingly sweet salted caramels flavors, so I wondered if the salted graham crackers would work. It was perfect! This would be my icecream s’more of choice.

My local Target stopped carrying it during the winter months, and then there it was in the freezer section the other day....my heart almost stopped. They brought it back for the summer!!

The pretzel swirl is to die for, and the marshmallow swirl and almond chunks are a great addition. but really, that pretzel swirl is life. I hope it gets incorporated into more flavors!

"Glampfire Trail Mix,Icecreamfan4life,2018-06-20,2,Not Glamping Girl,1,1,""I bought this flavor from my local Target last week along with a couple of other flavors. Figuring that, since I've come across a couple really good chocolate ice creams lately, I can't go wrong, right? Most especially with this being a B&J's flavor. But unfortunately, I have to say that this one missed the mark for me. :( I mean don't get me wrong, I had all the mix-in's, in the right amounts. But personally speaking, I felt like this was kind of another visit to salt lick city round two(first trip was via the Salted Caramel core flavor a while back), when I hit that pretzel swirl. I mean if I didn't eat straight from the middle where the marshmallow was and some of the not so salted part of the pretzels bits were or strictly the base that was on the outside of the swirl. I was just totally bombarded with a bunch of salt from the main part of the pretzel swirl. And it was soooo not good. Add to that, I am not quite sure what kind of fudge was made or bought to coat the almonds. But I beg of you B&J's, please find a way to tweak the recipe, some how. As I thought eating a couple of those would offset the salty flavor as well. But nope, the taste of that particular fudge just was not very appetizing to me. I'd recommend the fudge that is used to make the fish in Phish Food. But definitely not this new recipe. Sorry.""";;;

A lot of people have complained about the change from Chocolate covered peanutbutter FILLED pretzels to chocolate covered peanutbutter pretzels (it is my understanding that this was due to the original pretzels no longer being available to B&J's). While I do thing that the original was better in principal, I found that I frequently got pints where the pretzels were soggy and disappointing. I have never had that happen with the new recipe. The new pretzels are always crunch and a little bit saltier, which I actually prefer";" I need the salt to balance the fudge and vanilla malt. Still the best!""";;

Since moving to Texas from Pennsylvania in 2017, I noticed the cookie dough changed and became chalky. Not sure why in Texas it changed. It's become luck of the draw, sometimes it's good and sometimes I get a bad batch. Lately it's gotten better. Praying it stays that way.""";;;
"Half Baked,HalfBakedLover,2018-02-13,3,Quality isn't what it once was,0,0,""I would buy Half Baked at least once every two weeks and I generally stock up whenever it goes on sale since this is my favorite flavor. In the past year, I have noticed that the cookie dough has been very chalky and not at all chewy like it once was. Additionally, the brownie bites are no longer chewy and distinguishable, instead they just disappear with the chocolate ice cream. I attributed this to the fact that I stocked up on this particular ice cream however even with more recent purchases I have noticed that cookie dough and brownie bites are no longer the same texture and quantity as they used to be. This is my favorite ice cream so I hope they are able to pinpoint what exactly is going on with the recipe since they have said they have not changed it.""";;;

It was just super disappointing and wrong that I spent $7.00 for a pint of ice cream that was mediocre chocolate and vanilla... Won't EVER be buying this again.

One thing about this brand, if the product states that it has a certain thing in it (e.g., fudge, cheesecake, cookie dough), just know that you will get nice chunks of these ingredients in every bite. This is what sets Ben & Jerrys ice cream flavors apart from the other brands. They are very consistent with their products. Would definitely recommend any of their flavors.""";;;

There was also a severe lack of cookie dough and the brownie was stale. Very unfortunate and now I am scared to buy any more pints.;;;
Half Baked,,2018-11-04,5,,0,0,This is my favorite ice cream brand. The chunks of all of the cookie dough are really big so you get the brownie or cookie dough in every bite.

"Milk & Cookies,clouds513,2019-07-31,5,""The best flavor, anyone can fight me on this."",105,0,""I've been buying Milk & Cookies for i don't even know how long. I have to drive 30 minutes total just to go get it because none of my local stores have it. It's officially ruined all other cookies & cream flavored ice creams for me, nothing can top it. I mean, it't got TWO kinds of cookies in it. What??? Man that's a lot of cookie. And you know, every time I buy a pint, I always think """"man, is this $4-something-or-other worth it for just one pint?"""" and every time I get a different brand's cookies and cream flavor I always get my answer. It's absolutely worth it. This will be served at my wedding, and most certainly at my funeral. If anyone comes up to me and tries to convince me there's a better flavor out there, they can expect nothing less than a full on war.""";;;
"Milk & Cookies,Squilly,2020-01-23,5,The G.O.A.T,10,1,""I recently came across the Milk&Cookies flavor at my local convenient store and...WOW! If Oreo, Chips Ahoy, Tate's, Milano, and Nutella came together to make the best flavor of ice cream ever, it would not even come close to Milk&Cookies. The only problem is that I am becoming addicted and it is starting to affect my social life. Although my girlfriend dumped me and my friends no longer want to spend time with me, I will never stop eating Milk&Cookies Ice Cream. I am willing to take out a mortgage in order to purchase Milk&Cookie Ice Cream in larger quantities. Thank you Ben. Thank you Jerry.""";;;
"Milk & Cookies,Phish Food Fan,2019-02-26,5,One yummy flavor,6,0,""This is just what I was hoping for tonight. I love Ben and Jerry’s chocolatey, caramely, marshmallowy gooie flavors the most but tonight I wanted something different. I wanted exactly what Milk and Cookies delivered";" a delicious vanilla ice cream with cookie swirls. No fudge chunks or nuts or oozey mix ins this time (even though that’s my favorite). Just a perfect ‘dry’ blend of cookie swirls and excellent vanilla ice cream. I will get this one every time I need a break from the Phish Food, Karamel Sutra and peanut butter fudge cores of the world. Awesome flavor!""";;
"Milk & Cookies,Rocko13,2017-05-08,4,THE BEST - Just needs to be in more stores,9,0,""I was going to give it 5-stars, because it's BY FAR the best ice cream flavor that I've ever tasted! However, Milk & Cookies isn't available in a lot of stores, so it's definitely a challenge to find sometimes. Our local Whole Foods is really the only place that carries it. But, if you can find it, TRY IT! You won't be disappointed!""";;;
"Milk & Cookies,layla,2017-06-19,5,LOVE!,12,1,""I've been buying Ben & Jerry's for ages now, but I've never really been consistent with a certain flavor. I've always kept buying new ones to try. I'm on vacation in Florida, and found the Milk & Cookies one in the local grocery store and HAD to try it. Needless to say, we went back and grabbed 3 more the next day!""";;;

It all started, they were out of cookie dough (my old favorite) so decided to try the next best cookie thing on the shelf. Boy was I GLAD I did. It became my new favorite INSTANTLY. It’s so good though I have to really warm folks that you may NEVER want another flavor again. That’s what’s happened to me going on 3 years now since discovering it. My only problem with it is I’m mad I didn’t find out about it sooner!! I LOVE EVERY BUT ABOUT! 100 thumbs up!!! MMMMMM""";;;

It combines my favorite flavors, cookie dough and cookie's & cream creating the ultimate ice cream. With no overpowering crazy flavors, it took classic flavors and made them better. Ice cream will truly never taste the same - big shoutout to both Ben and Jerry for this one. (also it's a great post-run dessert)""";;;

Over the last several months, I’ve decided to spoon my way through every flavor I can get in my area or online and last night was Milk and Cookies. It was definitely yummy but not my favorite. The cookie swirls were GREAT! The vanilla ice cream was for some reason not my favorite. I think a chocolate milk and cookies would be better. And I love Ben and Jerry’s vanilla a lot. All in all, this was a good pint but I like a lot of other flavors more.""";;;

We love Half Baked but this one is like a soft cookie sundae. My favorite is getting those little chocolate chips in the mix, it just adds another layer of something already fantastic. It would be dope if there were full sized mini chocolate chips instead of the micro ones. Either way, great flippin' ice cream!""";;;
"Milk & Cookies,Haley g,2019-11-06,5,My one true love,1,0,""I have a deep and intense love for this ice cream. If I could marry it, I would.

I would like to be buried in a coffin shaped like a B&Js pint of Milk & Cookies ice cream. That is all.""";;;
"Milk & Cookies,Icrissyc,2018-04-27,5,Give it a try !,1,0,""I found myself wanting ice cream one day and I found this flavor in one of my local stores. I thought it would be strange with 2 different cookies , boy was I wrong ! Definetly one of my favorites of not my top favorite. Besides who's not in the mood for milk and cookies !?! You'd just be crazy if you said you weren't. HIGHLY suggest this flavor you will not regret it !""";;;

"Milk & Cookies,Stephanie A,2017-05-14,5,Recipe Suggestion,2,1,""This is literally the best ice cream flavor I have ever had! I'm actually eating it as I write this review. I just have one suggestion for the recipe...ADD MORE CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES!!!! This is a 10/10 ice cream flavor, but it would be a 20/10 if there were more chocolate chip cookie chunks in it!""";;;
"Milk & Cookies,ChrisColby,2018-07-25,4,Cookies. Cookies everywhere.,2,2,""Quite possibly the most accurate name for an ice cream flavor. Tastes exactly like cookies dipped in milk. The vanilla base is appropriately subtle enough to let the cookies shine, while adding the creaminess when melting. If there is one flaw, it's in the chocolate chocolate chip cookies which strangely taste a bit fruity. But that might just be me. Great flavor regardless.""";;;
"Milk & Cookies,Tanabear,2019-03-24,5,Cookie chunks!,1,0,""This is my favorite flavor. I get it anytime I am able! I love the swirls of cookie and the huge chunks of cookie that you get mixed in. I don't like cookie dough in ice-cream, so this works superbly. I love that it includes both chocolate cookies and chocolate chip cookies.""";;;
Milk & Cookies,shanelee266,2018-08-23,5,This cookie swirl is a game changer,1,0,My favorite flavor changes every year or so. Milk & Cookies is this years. What's the point of buying boring cookie dough flavor when this is available? The cookie swirl works so well and is such a great addition to the TWO kinds of cookie dough in this delicious blend.;;;
Milk & Cookies,Andreadiana,2017-12-18,5,A nod to your childhood,0,0,I picked up my first pint of Milk & Cookies a few years ago during a particularly hard time in my life. It was like a soothing balm during my emotional crisis. Could it be because it brings back a sense memory of better childhood times? Possibly. Or could it be because it is so darn tasty. I'm going with the latter. I have to really search my local stores for it and in the rare moments when they do have this flavor I buy multiple pints at once and look like a crazy woman. Thanks B&J. Thank you.;;;
"Milk & Cookies,PhoenixRises,2019-09-03,5,I just found this gem!,0,0,""Recently I went to a store that didn't have any of my usual favorites, so I grabbed this one just to see what it was like. I know I love cookies, and cookie sundaes so I would probably like it. I'm not a fan of cookie dough ice cream (I like it plain, but not in my ice cream), so I was glad it was regular cookie pieces. It was amazing! I love the chocolate cookie swirls and the chocolate chip cookie pieces. It's only sold at certain stores, so that's the only downside, but it's a new favorite.""";;;

Milk & Cookies,bec99,2019-01-07,5,best combo!!,0,0,Ever since I found this flavor it is the only flavor I will buy. It is the perfect combination of different cookies and only has vanilla ice cream which is different from most flavors and that is a big pro in my eyes.

I ate two pints in one sitting! My doctor says I need to stop buying Ben and Jerrys because of my diabetes but I can't stop! Aaahhh! I love this ice cream so much that I have to sneak it in the house because my family tries to hide it from me. I've stopped eating regular food and I basically just eat ice cream every meal.

"Mint Chocolate Cookie,Chunk Lover,2017-05-02,1,Chocolate cookies where?,6,5,""As a chunk fan who loves half baked, I recently decided to stop loyally buying my pints of Half Baked and gave this flavor a try. I read it was supposed to have big, generous sized cookie pieces all throughout the pint. Well, my pint didn't have a single big cookie chunk! It was just very small crumbles and mainly mint ice cream. I'm so disappointed! I was expecting this to be the ultimate ice cream for chunk lovers based on what I heard. :(""";;;
"Mint Chocolate Cookie,BJfan4life,2020-07-30,3,Yummy but disappointing,0,1,""I was so excited to finally try the Mint Chocolate Cookie ice cream. I'm a huge mint chocolate chip fan, mint ice cream fan in general. But with the concoctions that B&J puts together to make some of the best ice cream flavors around, this flavor is disappointing. I would have expected chocolate chunks, swirls of chocolate, or even the Andes mint chocolates that are sold in stores. But this is basically cookies n cream ice cream with mint flavor. The ice cream isn't even green. Yes it's still yummy, but doesn't live up to what Ben & Jerry's is capable of throwing together.""";;;
"Mint Chocolate Cookie,Nicki237,2019-07-12,5,Amazing!!!,0,0,""I bought this flavor yesterday at Walgreens for $6.94 and I must say this flavor is ADDICTING! It’s so good. Ben & Jerry’s knows the perfect balance. The mint flavor is clean and authentic and not sickeningly sweet and artificial and it’s not green like most mint ice creams. Plus, the cookies in here are big pieces, the more I ate through the pint, the bigger the cookie pieces got. It’s as if Cookies & Cream Icecream, York Peppermint patty & Oreos had a baby. I just wish it wasn’t so expensive! I need coupons so I can stock up on this flavor! PLEASE Don’t ever get rid of it!""";;;
Mint Chocolate Cookie,Mquinn,2020-04-24,1,No cookies :(,0,0,First time trying this flavor and it wasn’t good. There were no cookie pieces at all. I kept waiting to get to the bottom and still no cookies. The bottom was even hollow so 1/4 of the container just had nothing but air.;;;

I did look at the website before going to the store, and didn't see coconut oil in the ingredients. Maybe the website needs to be updated?? Would be more vigilant next time at the store and read all products. Ben & Jerry's does make great ice cream, I just got to be more proactive and always double check.""";;;
"Mint Chocolate Cookie,Nate,2019-12-06,1,The mint flavor that is forever leading you on.,0,1,""At first bite I could taste a mellow mint flavor over what is otherwise Chocolate Cookie Vanilla Ice Cream"; sadly I sat there eating the rest of the pint not out of enjoyment but out of a desperate attempt to acquire the elusive mint flavor that was lacking. Long story short, I ate the entire pint and was disappointed not only in this flavor but myself. Also the texture was missing that of a chewy/crunch found only in a chocolate chip;" if you are looking for that added chocolaty textured greatness the cookie alone will not bring you any solace.""";

Mint Chocolate Cookie,Foreversienna,2017-10-12,2,Not enough chunks,2,2,I read several review on the good size of chunks and Great flavors. So when I was at my local supermarket and I saw this flavor I decided to step away from my usual purchase of phish food and half baked. But unfortunately I was very disappointed. There were no large chunks like reviews said. I am hoping thsi was a manufacturing error of some sort but the small pieces I did taste were also odd tasting.;;;

"Mint Chocolate Cookie,coclico,2020-09-02,5,Disgustingly good.,0,0,""The mint cookie is truly the most supreme ice cream flavor ever invented: not too minty, not too chocolatey... perfect distribution of ingredients, and don't get me started on the exquisite texture. It's unfortunate that I have to eat the whole pint in one sitting. I recently moved to a city with a store that has this magnificent flavor stocked almost every day. The previous place I lived... there was some sort of shortage. I could only find it in random stores once or twice a year. SO, you'd think this is a GOOD thing: that I now have access to my favorite flavor almost every day. Guys, this is a HORRIBLE thing. The store near me is also open 24 hours... you get the picture. So, I declare to anyone who reads these things: TODAY IS MY LAST DAY TO TASTE AND ENJOY THIS SUPERB AMBROSIA> I'm kicking it... tomorrow. """;;;

Just looking at that glassy smooth ice cream just after taking the lid off makes my mouth water.

"Minter Wonderland,Jonathan L,2020-02-06,5,Review Time.,7,0,""I have contemplated this review for quite some time. Unfortunately, it is officially time to let you all know about the greatest ice cream EVER MADE! I am flabbergasted that more people have never heard of this ingenious creation. It is by far the most perfected ice cream, which contains the best combination of flavors and ingredients to hit this planet. I am saddened to know that this review will for sure be read by millions and in turn lower my chances of being the only one at my local target eating this ice cream. I have withheld this important message for this long due to my own need to always have a fully stocked freezer of this amazing product. All i ask is that if you are contemplating buying more than 15 of these pints at once, just leave enough for myself to stock my personal Minter Wonderland freezer at home. Now to get to the real reason for this review. I am hoping that one of the millions that read this review may work for Ben and Jerry's or Target and start the long needed process to make this ice cream available ALL year and in ALL locations. Thank you and please do not touch MY Minter Wonderland pint.""";;;

Dark chocolate ice creams and milk shakes are my favorite and surprisingly most difficult flavor to find. I was instantly hooked on the dark chocolate flavor of this ice cream. The minty cookies are refreshing and the marshmallow swirl adds just the perfect sweetness.""";;;

New York Super Fudge Chunk,Mazzarox,2020-03-01,5,Incredible ice cream!,2,0,This is without a doubt my all time favourite ice cream. I used to love phish food but then I discovered New York super fudge chunk and have never looked back. Not just my favourite Ben & Jerry’s ice cream but my favourite ice cream. The chocolate is divine and all the different chunks are really what makes it so special. It’s just a shame that it’s so hard to come by at times and I am terrified that one day it might get discontinued. I might just have to buy in bulk now and save up just in case!;;;
New York Super Fudge Chunk,KatL,2019-01-27,5,Perfectly Super,3,0,In my opinion this is the best flavor by far. It is so fun to find a chocolate covered nut and chocolate chips. I am not a white chocolate fan but this ice cream is super chocolatey and the while chocolate really complements it. It is super chocolate! And it is so hard to find in stores it is always sold out. Maybe it should move up in the ranks of the favorite flavors.;;;

The level of variety of textures in this is really an enjoyable experience unlike other ice creams that try to work in nuts or chunks of chewables that really feel like a hindrance to the chewing aspect, but not this. No. This is done right and there is nothing more that could be improved upon. Love this!""";;;

Sadly this flavor is not as great. I've had it twice now and both times I was disappointed by the large amount of chocolate flakes versus actual oatmeal cinnamon cookies. The only thing that was right about this was the brown sugar base does taste like the cinnamon base from the original flavor. Anyway, I digress... It'll have to do since it's the closest they've gotten to resurrecting the Oatmeal Cookie Chunk. Just please less fudge flakes or you guys might as well change the name....""";;;

I feel like a good oatmeal cookie doesn't have chocolate in it - reserve that for the chocolate chip fans out there. But I tried this anyway, figuring the chocolate might be limited enough I could just grimace and get through it, but nope :( The chocolate was more apparent than the oatmeal cookie itself. This one was just an extra stab in the heart because I was holding out hope that the chocolate chunks were less common than they are in the Cherry Garcia.""";;;

I missed the Oatmeal Cookie Chuck (my absolutely all time favorite flavor) oh so much. But the excitement soon was lost when I realized it was not the same OCC I loved so much. There was no chunks of cookies in the ice cream, and I know it's supposed to be a swirl, but 1) it would actually be out of this world if there were the original OCC chunks in it and 2) there was hardly any oatmeal cookie swirl in it. I've bought it a few more times hoping that the production has gotten better with adding more of the oatmeal cookie, but nothing has changed. Very sad. I just wish they could add in the cookie chunks in it like they do for milk and cookies (but oatmeal of course). :(""";;;

I really just wanted to try it because of the flavors lol. I've been kinda disappointed lately though because I always bought this flavor from Walmart or Food Lion, and I guess they've stopped carrying it because I've been in multiple locations for each store and none have it anymore.

Not gonna lie, it's good enough that I (shamefully, and maybe a little drunkenly) was compelled to steal a small spoonful after a late night out. The brown sugar base is just so rich, that when paired with the oat cookies, you just feel all warm and cozy. Like grandma just visited, minus the raisins. It has chocolate flakes though, which have just enough bitterness to them that you're not overwhelmed by the buttery base. Safe to say after my dip into thievery had passed (and I had a 12 hour nap) I went and got my own pint. Sorry girlie! It only happened once I swear.""";;;

I can’t stop thinking about it though, after I tried it I haven’t seen it stocked in a store since then, and I literally look EVERY day so I can buy them all up. If it was regularly stocked I would be eating this 3 times a week at least it’s that good. It’s so buttery and perfectly sweet, but the chocolate and cinnamon flavors add the perfect amount of savory to balance everything out. I can’t help but think how awesome it would be with the cookie dough pieces added to it as well if I was feeling really indulgent. I wish I could get my hands on this stuff again.""";;;

I thought the brown sugar ice cream base was really good as was the oatmeal cinnamon swirls, but for me it was ruined by the excessive amount of fudge flakes, which to me really aren't flakes but more like chunks. There were just too many that I ended up tasting more of the fudge than anything else and eventually had to eat around them. I think at least half as many fudge flakes could have been used and still served it's purpose. I'd likely only buy it again if I knew there was less flakes in it.""";;;

But, the cookie definitely did not have any of the amazing chunks I was expecting, and to further disappoint, barely had any traces/flavoring swirled in at all. The base was good (and maybe even an improvement on the Oatmeal Cookie!), but it really did not make up for the lack of cookie. Oh Ben and Jerrys, why do you tease me so?!""";;;

Oat of This Swirled,FuzzyGut,2018-08-02,5,Excellent flavor,2,0,A nearly perfect pint. There were TONS of fudge chips in this one and the cookie swirl was dense and super yummy. The ice cream didn’t scream ‘buttery brown sugar’ though. It’s really good tasting ice cream and you do get a hint of those flavors but it could have been coming off the cookie swirl as easily.

That said, if OCC tasted anything like Oat of this Swirled, NO WONDER fans have been begging for its return for so long. This flavor is absolutely delicious! The swirl perfectly captures that baked cinnamon and oat taste you'd expect from the cookie but without any oats as far as I can tell. The buttery brown sugar base, which has always been one of B&J's best, perfectly compliments the swirl, cementing the cookie theme in taste.

Also not for me. What is 'for me' is gone";" The oatmeal cookie without any of this gooey gross stuff that reminds me of every other gimmicky approach Ben and Jerry's takes with their icecream.

"Oat of This Swirled,ariicecream5,2017-10-24,5,The greatest of them all,0,0,""Oat of this Swirled has all the elements . . . it's got those classic B&J chocolate chunks, it's got those perfect cookie bites, it's got a nice, subtle, creamy base, it's got swirls of sugary deliciousness. I LOVE THIS FLAVOR! It's unseated Chunky Monkey after maybe half a decade as my FAVORITE OF THEM ALL!""";;;
"Oat of This Swirled,Brianna,2020-05-02,3,""No cookie, lots of chocolate"",0,0,There is barely any oatmeal cookie in this ice cream which is really disappointing since Ben and Jerry’s always has lots of good stuff in their ice cream. There are WAY TO many big pieces of fudge flakes. I was so upset I MADE MY OWN OATMEAL COOKIES TO SWIRL IN!!! When you do get a rare piece of cookie it is good.";;;
Oat of This Swirled,McCaulley Culkin,2018-08-15,5,Best Flavor in the World!,0,0,It is my favorite ice cream flavor of all time. BUT I do think that there needs to be more oatmeal cookie chunks and less fudge chips - or at least make the fudge chips smaller. Definitely more cookie chunks though! But it is delicious and if you ever stop making it.. I. WILL. NEVER. FORGIVE. YOU. BEN. & JERRY. :);;;
"Oat of This Swirled,RedSoxRoxMySox,2017-07-18,5,I don't even like oatmeal,0,0,""A die-hard half-baked fan, i have seen the light. If Jesus got bored with plants and animals and peoples and decided to make an ice cream, it would be brown sugar. Beyoncé named the twins after this flavor. This was Victoria's Secret. I don't even like Oats and this ice cream still gave me a reason to live. Amen.""";;;
"Oat of This Swirled,Baby,2020-06-28,2,Too much fudge,0,0,""I just bought this because I like the idea of oatmeal cookies in ice cream, but every spoonful was just fudge flakes. The ice cream itself is very good, but there are simply too many fudge flakes. I can understand putting a few in for texture, but this just made the ice cream too crunchy and was a disappointment.""";;;
"Oat of This Swirled,PhantomFears685,2017-10-01,5,Serious Love,0,0,""This ice cream tastes like someone took an oatmeal cookie and made it into ice cream without being overbearing with the oatmeal or the cinnamon. Then, just for fun, they put chocolate in it.""";;;

It would be easy to make the rookie mistake of going for the cream when you're only feeling somewhat ~nutty~ but this is a flavor that makes you commit. So before you purchase, ask yourself, am I feeling nuts enough for this today? If the answer is yes, then taking home a pint of this ice cream will probably be the best decision you make all day. This is not necessarily my favorite flavor, but it is a fantastic one.""";;;

It’s a simple concoction: peanut butter ice cream loaded with little peanut butter cups, and it is SUBLIME! As per usual, the ice cream flavor and texture are perfect and the pb cups are also.

Peanut Butter Cup,Intcel,2018-04-05,5,Love it!,1,0,I am addicted to this ice cream. The only negative thing I can come up with is when there are too many butter cup chunks are in the same pot.

It’s rich and creamy. The flavor of peanut butter and cookie swirls is also really really good. My problem is with how hard the swirls are. In my 3 pints, they were so hard that I could barely crack them with my spoon and they come out in one really big mass which makes eating the ice cream a bit of a wrestling match. But it all tastes SO good! It’s really decedent and rich and extremely filling. I will continue to buy it, I just wish it was easier to eat.""";;;

I don’t to stop exploring new flavors but I feel like maybe I should just stick to my tried-and-true favorites. I’m sorry to be a downer but I’m really not happy that 2 out of 2 peanut butter pints had inedible swirls and cores! I usually give gushing, glowing reviews on here and I’m not a hard to please jerk.

Peanut Butter World,NLK1,2018-02-01,5,OMG - Beyond Yummy,2,0,This is a MUST. I tried it for the first time about a month ago. I've been looking for it ever since. EUREKA!!! I found it again yesterday and bought two. I so love this flavor! THANK YOU for being so wonderful.;;;
Peanut Butter World,LibrarianLynn,2017-06-08,5,Wowza!,2,0,SO good! I would make a special trip to Target just to get this. VERY glad that B&J resisted putting hard chunks in this flavor like they do in so many of their flavors. This is rich and chewy and perfect.;;;
"Peanut Butter World,Mackkwalkk,2018-01-09,5,Awesome,2,0,""I love all Ben and Jerry’s and this is my absolute favorite! I’ve been stocking up since it’s an exclusive. I would hate to see this flavor go, definitely should be added to the list of full time flavors!!""";;;
Peanut Butter World,EDVaughn,2018-06-21,5,Best Ben and Jerry’s Flavor,2,0,And it’s not even close! Just wish it was everywhere instead of just at Target. Three times I have planned on making it last multiple evenings. All three times I finished the whole pint in one sitting.;;;
"Peanut Butter World,Bruce,2017-05-25,5,Absolutely perfect!!!!,2,0,""This might be the best flavor of ice cream ever!! Please consider selling it at non Target locations so everyone can get their hands on this! At the very least, don't stop selling it there!""";;;
"Peanut Butter World,Peanut Butter Lover,2018-10-28,1,Misleading Flavor Name,6,25,""How can this flavor be called """"Peanut Butter World"""" when 2 out of the 3 ingredients listed in the description of the ice cream are chocolate? And in the ice cream itself, it's 95% chocolate. Is this a joke? The title makes no sense. Where's the peanut butter in this peanut butter world? The description says """"Milk Chocolate Ice Cream with Peanut Buttery Swirls & Chocolate Cookie Swirls"""". How did you come up with the title from those ingredients? I love Ben & Jerry's ice cream, but y'all put chocolate in almost every flavor, even when it doesn't belong and it's so unnecessary. I love peanut butter flavored everything and most peanut buttery treats aren't peanut buttery enough for me. I just don't like chocolate that much and because of that I was very disappointed with this flavor.""";;;
Peanut Butter World,You can call me David,2017-04-18,5,This is the. Perfect. Ice. Cream.,2,0,This is the only flavor I buy anymore. It is the epitome of ice cream. I dare anyone to try it and say otherwise.;;;

I love the combination of the peanut butter and rich chocolate ice cream. The cookie swirl is so good! Please don't stop making this flavor. It is one of your best in my opinion. This is my new favorite flavor!;;;
Peanut Butter World,Loonat64,2018-01-29,5,Yum!,1,0,It's. So. Good. Definitely the best flavor to come out in a long time! But please make it available in places other than Target.

Peanut Butter World,Natasha,2017-08-13,5,Perfect Amount of Peanut Butter,1,0,I'm always searching for ice cream with peanut butter and often disappointed by the sparse amounts of peanut butter.

"Peanut Butter World,melia29,2018-09-03,5,Best PB ice cream there is!!!,0,0,""I love peanut butter in general and have tried many peanut butter ice creams. From the moment I tried Peanut Butter World, I knew I had found a favorite. What makes it different (and freakin delicious) is the crunch of cookie in every bite. There was a period of time when Target was sold out and I was seriously going through withdrawals! If you love peanut butter, do yourself a favor and try this ice cream. You’re welcome.""";;;
"Peanut Butter World,lauren327,2018-09-11,5,Please don't EVER stop making this!,0,0,""I've been buying this flavor for about three years now, and while I'm not a fan of ice cream typically, this is DIVINE. I buy it 4 canisters at a time at any Target I can find. Some may say it has too much peanut butter in it (or something similarly insane), but this is really the only ice cream on the planet that I enjoy. I only wish I could find it at more places.""";;;
"Peanut Butter World,WickedAnnabella,2020-08-16,5,Best Peanut Butter Swirls!,0,0,""This is the #1 best chocolate-peanut butter ice cream you can buy. Ben & Jerry's other peanut butter ice creams are not as good due to the inclusion of mini peanut butter cups, which lack the peanut butter flavor you get from the swirls in this flavor. As far as I know you can only buy Peanut Butter World at Target, and I've made special trips just for this!""";;;
"Peanut Butter World,Marisa,2020-04-24,5,Siren's Call,0,0,""Every time I think I have shaken off my love for this ice cream the combination of sweet chocolate and salty peanut butter drags me back in. The chocolate is sweet without being cloying, and the peanut butter offsets that perfectly. This is the ice cream I choose to splurge on (eat an entire container of) for my birthday.""";;;
"Peanut Butter World,Kristenmarie211,2020-04-26,5,By far my favorite flavor,0,0,""My favorite part about Ben & Jerry's is that they don't have corn Syrup in the ingredients. At least not with this flavor. I think their ice cream has remained the same and most wonderful and as corn syrup does horrible things to my skin, Ben & Jerry's gives me the ice cream i crave, without the breakouts.""";;;
"Peanut Butter World,LaLaLady,2020-08-05,5,My new fave flavor,0,0,""im a huge pb fan and this was done so well! Ribbons of peanut butter and then cookie crunchies add delicious texture to the creamy chocolate ice cream. Thanks B&J! Only downside is being exclusive to Target, my first trip there they were out.

"Phish Food,Lilbitsweets,2017-08-08,5,Hi I'm Linda and I'm a Phish Food Addict!!,22,6,""I feel like I'm literally addicted to Ben and Jerry's Phish Food! It seems as if I can't get enough of the super creamy chocolate ice cream with the heavenly swirls of Marshmallow and Carmel throughout it and the wonderful little bonuses of fudge fish that are so """"chocolatey"""" that they quench my desires & cravings!! But then as I start to see my spoon scraping the bottom of the container I rush to my freezer just to make sure I've got 1 more pint of Phish Food in there for later!!! Phish Food has all the """"bells & whistles"""" that will please any ice cream chocohlic!!! My final words: Ben and Jerry's Phish Food Ice Cream is DAMNDIDDLYICIOUS!!!!!!! (my made up word for very delicious)""";;;
"Phish Food,joannenicole89,2018-10-20,5,Still unrivalled as my favourite ice cream,8,0,""I cannot speak more highly of this flavour. I love that it has the perfect balance of both taste and texture: The sweet and soft marshmallow swirls, offset by the mildly bitter and crunchy fudge fish, and tied together with caramel. I usually eat a whole pint on my own, and would save each """"phish"""" so I get one in each spoonful towards the end. I always wish there was more! Nevertheless, it's still my favourite flavour, and I hope it doesn't get forgotten or overshadowed by the newer products. This brand is so expensive in my country, but I still save up and buy it as often as I can. It's THAT good.""";;;
"Phish Food,dtk9,2018-05-18,5,Absolutely perfect,10,0,""Sometimes I think, man, Ben and Jerry's is kinda expensive... then I see this flavor on the shelf and I'm ready to go in debt. Let me just say, you guys need to put marshmallows in your ice cream more often (in recipes that make sense of course lol). The texture for this ice cream is wonderful and I really think it's because of the marshmallows. I have never bought Phish Food and been unsatisfied. And the thing is: I don't even care for chocolate ice cream. It's the flavor I always come back to, even when I swear to try something different.""";;;

It was a hot day and I am basically okay with any kind of ice cream so I asked if I could have it and she said, 'Sure'. I went and grabbed a plastic spoon from the cabinet, opened the pint, and stuck the spoon in scooping up some ice cream. Before that moment I thought all ice cream was more or less similar.

What could be better than that? Sadly, I now live in Montreal, and have checked every ice cream selling market/deppaneur/etc. and cannot find this flavour anywhere! I need my fix! This is torture! (....and I don’t understand how we have such a huge French and Italian population here, why this is not one of the few flavours sold here!). :(""";;;

Having been to Italy several times, I've had my share of amazing pistachio gelato. B&J's does it even better as you have the smooth, creamy lightly pistachio-flavored ice cream and lots of toasted pistachios for that great crunch within the creamy......perfection! Sadly, I've never been to a B&J's that offers this flavor, and it is pretty difficult to find in grocery stores and drug stores. So....when you do.....nab them all! :D You're welcome!

Before I even got home from the store I felt assured that I had found my new favorite ice cream (love pistachios), something to rival the pistachio gelato I get from my local coffee shop. Unfortunately, once I broke that bad boy open I was dismayed that what should've been a culinary treat was in fact plain, non-flavorful ice cream with hunks of rather hard pistachios in it. I was very disappointed with the experience and hope to never run across a similarly disappointing flavor again.""";;;

I was looking forward to it all day. But when I finally tried it, it was not the same ice cream I was used to. The pistachios were soft and chewy and the ice cream did not taste like pistachio ice cream. I went to the same store again to buy another pint 2 days later and I was rewarded with the same bland tasting ice cream with soft pistachios. Plus once the ice cream melted a little, it was a little too frothy like there was extra milk or something in this particular batch. So very disappointed with Ben & Jerry's. I love this flavor, but not sure I want to risk a 3rd time.""";;;

It is made in limited batches, and was NEVER in the same store every year, so you became an explorer to find it each year! Was it in Walmart, Wegman's, Shop Rite, CVS, or where every September? I knew this was the time the first batch was delivered! FINALLY, this year they have a specific page on their website for Pumpkin Cheesecake. All you have to do is put in your zip code, and it will tell you where is the nearest establishment to purchase this in incredibly, tasty, scrumptiously delicious frozen treat!!!

I have been wanting to try this flavor, and figured it was long gone, but to my surprise I was able to find it, so I figured it was a sign from above. Overall, the pumpkin flavor tastes familiar... But over seasoned... It is a bit boring, and honestly this ice cream could be amazing. The graham cracker swirl is more of a.... occasional chunk. Honestly, the graham cracker swirl was to die for!! It was the highlight of this ice cream... If they could just add more swirl, I would be much more impressed overall. The swirl definitely breaks up the boredum of the ice cream, it is a bit repetitive. I think a huge glob of swirl would be amazing.""";;;

Figured since it was my year to try out some of these much beloved pumpkin spice and pumpkin flavored items, that come out. I would give this ice cream a try. I'll be the first to admit pumpkin flavored anything is not a go to favorite flavor for me during the Fall or otherwise. So I had low expectations going in. But once I tried out a little bit that was inside the lid....have to say I fell in love with this super light pumpkin flavor. Even enjoyed the light graham cracker swirl. Just the further down I went into the pint, not sure if it was do to the larger the swirl became or the mix of the graham cracker with the spice in the pumpkin in the base. But the taste of the swirl just got real nasty throughout the middle section of the pint. But it got better again towards the end though.""";;;

"""Red, White & Blueberry"",Nathalier12,2019-06-09,3,it has potential.,10,4,""i give this icecream a 3 star. because 5 js licking spoon to its core. 4 is not enough chunks but yummy creamy icecream flavor. 3 is.... well this. def not enough cookie or strawberry. and not enough blueberry icecream flavor. needs LOTS more. tasted like vanilla icream with very rare moments of tastebud excitement when the tiny chunks of shortbread were finally dug up. Did i eat it in 2 days? yes. Did i enjoy eating it? yes. Did i look forward to wating it in the future? no i forgot about it which means it wasnt great.

"""Red, White & Blueberry"",metalpasta,2019-06-21,3,Where's the raspberries?,4,1,""I read the description of this flavor and thought this might be an instant classic. Raspberry and blueberry ice cream? And strawberries too? Ooh! But I have to say this flavor was a disappointment. All I could taste was vanilla and the shortbread. Now blueberry isn't the strongest flavor in the world, but you would think it could be amped up at least a little. And maybe it's just me but I could not taste the raspberry at all. And the pint I purchased had only a few bites of strawberry. The flavor was not bad, but it was nothing like i was expecting. Instead of """"wow!"""", all I experienced was """"meh"""".

"""Red, White & Blueberry"",Icecreamfan4life,2019-05-09,5,Totally unexpected willy wonka experience!,8,2,""Okay as I said in another review. I bought this with 2 other flavors(Sammie flavor and the sweet like sugar flavor), and I was the most leery of this flavor. As I tend to enjoy fresh blue and raspberries as opposed to having them in ice creams. As they just don't taste right or good to me. But in this flavor. I'm not sure if it was the fact that there was the vanilla swirl and short bread cookies, that balanced things out or what. But this turned out to be a lot better than I expected. Again, I know others may not like it, because it's not one of B&J's chunck induced, fudge freckled classics. But it's definitely a step in the right direction in balancing out more natural even flavors, with deep, rich, and sometimes too salty flavors as well. So definitely keep mixing it up for sure.""";;;

I found 3 threads of red that, if you squinted, might have been strawberry. The globs of shortcake were a disgusting greenish color and again, too sweet. No fruit flavors. Would I buy this again??

Tasted like a decent chocolate ice cream but other than that it was generic and didn’t have much of a s’mores taste to it.""";;;
S'mores,Amy77,2019-05-18,5,Best Ice Cream Ever!!!!!!!,0,0,Omg! This is the BEST ice cream you’ll ever have. It’s hard do find. They don’t even have it at their own ice cream shop. Gimme s’more is nothing like it - I wouldn’t even buy that. “S’mores” is the best! I hope they keep making it. It’s smooth and not too sweet. The chocolate flavor is awesome combined with graham crackers and marshmallows!! I LOVE this ice cream!!!;;;
S'mores,ColoradoKate,2018-05-05,5,More S'mores I Implore,0,0,Been buying this chocolaty delight since my daughter was a toddler.....and she's now a licensed driver. This decadent flavor is my before-bed ritual. Smooth rich deep chocolate flavor with delicious fudge chunks and swirls of lip-smacking goodness. None of your other flavors compare to this delight. S'mores will always have a place in my heart.....and freezer.;;;
"S'mores,Shaina,2018-01-11,2,A bit sad,0,1,""I have been a Ben and Jerry’s lover since childhood. With that being said it is rare that I come across a flavor that I am not a fan of. Being that I love Ben and Jerry’s as well as s’mores, I was really excited to try this. The base flavor was fine but I was not reminded of s’mores while eating this. I actually didn’t even finish the pint, which never happens.""";;;
"S'mores,Voltages230,2019-12-03,1,Not the flavor you're expecting,0,1,""I would expect a S'mores flavored ice cream to taste like my favorite dessert ever, a S'more. What I ended up getting was an overpowered chocolate flavor with tiny hints of graham cracker and even more chocolate in the form of the fudge chunks. I'm pretty disappointed in this flavor as usually I love B&J ice cream. Definitely won't be purchasing this again.""";;;
"S'mores,jennk83,2018-08-27,5,Best flavor,0,0,""This is my all-time favorite Ben & Jerry’s flavor. They changed it up a bit sometime in the last couple of years, but it’s still very delicious. It has become increasingly difficult to find since the introduction of “Gimme S’more” (which I do not enjoy half as much), so when I do manage to find it, I stock up. Perfect flavor combination, not to be missed.""";;;
"S'mores,Vonnie,2017-05-30,1,Not What I Was Expecting,0,3,""I am a S'mores fanatic, so once I saw this in the grocery store, I went crazy! Lol I was expecting a marshmallow based ice cream with a fudge swirl and Graham cracker and fudge chunks. Unfortunately, I found myself eating chocolate flavored ice cream. The Smores flavor was overpowered by the chocolate smh I tried, but it was nothing that I was expecting.""";;;
"S'mores,vtmmm,2018-03-08,5,Taste of Summer with Lots of Chocolate,0,0,""My current favorite flavor! I love the creamy marshmallow swirls and the sandy texture of graham cracker crumbs, plus chocolate chunks. Some people feel it's not """"balanced"""" enough, but as a chocolate person I'm perfectly happy to have my s'mores be more chocolate than anything! It's as if you took your s'more and crumbled it in chocolate ice cream!""";;;
"S'mores,sublimecls,2019-04-07,5,""Amazing flavor, my fav!!"",0,0,""This flavor is just PERFECTION for me! The dark chocolatey ice cream base is stellar, the gritty swirls of almost wet sand textured graham cracker is SO GOOD and the touches of toasted marshmalllow swirled throughout just top it off perfectly. I will never survive if they get rid of this flavor. I hat when I can’t find it in stock!""";;;
S'mores,JakeJr9,2018-07-01,5,SPECTACULAR SMORES,0,0,Hey stores in Delaware - if you want my grocery business you had better start stocking this flavor. My favorite used to be chocolate and peanut butter ice cream. But once I tried Smores I find myself driving around until I find a store that carries it. Do yourself a favor - if you have not tried this flavor - do so now.;;;
S'mores,Bryant,2020-08-22,5,Best I have ever had!!!,0,0,My wife and I treat ourselves to Ben and Jerry’s on Friday nights. We used to buy S’mores and share it every Friday for 8 years!!! We can’t find it anywhere in North Carolina anymore. None of the other flavors are even close to comparing. Very sad that we can’t get it. It’s not even available in the online store.;;;
S'mores,Gustine,2018-03-19,2,Disappointed,0,1,I was excited to see my store finally selling the s’mores flavor so I obviously bought it. I started eating it today and it’s just chocolate ice cream with a little bit of graham cracker and almost no marshmallow. I won’t be buying this again but I will recommend my favorites: Cherry Garcia and The Tonight Dough;;;
S'mores,Nicky91,2017-09-21,1,Disappointing,0,2,I feel like they really dropped the ball with this flavor. The marshmallow and Graham crackers are entirely overpowered by the chocolate ice cream and chunks of fudge. I had really high hopes for this one. I think it would be so much better with a Graham flavored ice cream or even a marshmallow one.;;;
"S'mores,momo9324,2017-09-21,2,Poor S'more Flavor,0,0,""I had high expectations for this ice cream as I love anything s'more flavor, but this ice cream just didn't cut it. It literally just tasted like chocolate ice cream. No graham cracker or marshmallow flavor at all. Sorry Ben & Jerry's, love your ice cream, but this flavor could use some work""";;;
S'mores,Lauren14,2018-02-09,5,I LOVE S'MORES,0,0,This flavor is my favorite because of the graham cracker swirls; they are to die for. This is always my ice cream go to and I am so sad that s'mores isn't sold at most ben&jerrys retailers. I have such a hard time finding it these days that I usually am forced to settle for other flavors.;;
S'mores,Vali,2017-04-26,3,Too much chocolate,1,2,Insanely chocolatey. Needs more marshmallow and graham crackers because all I could taste was chocolate.;;;
"S'mores,Adrienne,2017-08-21,1,Lack of S'mores,0,2,""Not your typical summer treat flavor...the chocolate ice cream is overpowering and the taste of graham cracker and marshmallow bits is non-existent. Very disappointed by our choice of ice cream. Ben & Jerry's is known for exceptional and creative flavors, but this one misses the mark.""";;;
"S'mores,Mbrown80,2019-01-06,1,Yuck,0,1,""Tastes nothing like s'mores. Such dark chocolate ice cream...i don't understand why it has fudge, as s'mores do not...the marshmallow is not enough to help the overpowering darkness of the ice cream, and the graham doesn't taste at all, just contributes a sandy texture. Hard pass.""";;;
"S'mores,morganutley,2017-08-10,5,Favorite Flavor!,0,0,""The Dutch chocolate base is DELICIOUS, and the occasional bites of crumbled graham cracker, marshmallow, and chocolate just make it that much better. Purists may prefer more """"S'mores"""" flavor, as the chocolate ice cream is really bold, but I think it's beyond excellent as is.""";;;
"S'mores,Stine70,2017-10-25,5,""Love, love, love this flavor"",0,0,""I am always on the hunt for this flavor when we visit a grocery store. I can’t get enough of the rich chocolate, buttery graham cracker, marshmallow swirl and chocolate pieces. I try so hard to ration it out, but I’m usually done in 4-5 nights. Thx for the yummy creation!""";;;
S'mores,Brandy35,2017-05-07,3,Ehhh,1,2,I was excited to try the smores....but the chocolate overpowered everything.;;;
S'mores,av3rros,2017-12-04,1,Drowning in Chocolate,0,3,This is one of Ben & Jerry's most disappointing flavors. It tastes like nothing but chocolate ice cream. I didn't taste a single fudge chunk or roasted marshmallow it it. and that graham cracker swirl was non-existent. I'm shocked this hasn't made it to the graveyard yet.;;;
"S'mores,tiredfrom work,2017-07-04,2,Isn't all that much different from Phish Food,0,0,""As a chocolate ice cream, it's OK, but if you're going to call an ice cream smores, it should at least taste like smores. This is nothing but chocolate. I barely see any marshmallow,and I don't know where the graham crackers are supposed to be. Pretty disappointing.""";;;
S'mores,SmoresLover,2018-03-26,5,BEST FLAVOR EVER,0,0,S'mores has been my favorite flavor for YEARS. I love the chocolate base and the surprise of the marshmallow and graham cracker swirls within. Lately I haven't been able to find it in stores very often. Please don't send to the flavor graveyard. I would seriously cry.;;;
"S'mores,Krystle,2018-08-13,1,Only chocolate,0,1,""I just opened my pint, when I took off the lid, I saw marshmallow, I was excited. But after I got threw that small layer of marshmallow, I couldn't find anymore. I didn't see or taste any Graham cracker. And I only saw a few chocolate chips. I think I got a mistake!""";;;
S'mores,TammyC,2017-05-16,2,Not worth the cost,0,0,I bought this yesterday and I went to 4 differrrnt stores until I found it! I was so happy then when I tasted it I didn't see any marshmallow until I reached the middle and it was too much chocolate I spent over 8 bucks because I got two and I was very disappointed.;;;
S'mores,johanna,2018-07-23,5,favorite,0,0,this is my fave b&j flavor!!! however i have been seeing less and less of this flavor in stores. i hope they are trying to replace it with that horrid “gimme s’more” flavor...that flavor could never compare to this classic. please keep this flavor ben and jerry’s!!;;;
"S'mores,Nickolaix,2018-09-14,5,Favorite Flavor,0,0,""I read other reviews that claimed that the chocolate overpowers the other components, but I think that is what I like.

"S'mores,JennP,2020-04-14,5,This is so chocolately...Best flavor,0,0,""This is my FAVORITE B&J ice cream. The chocolate ice cream is so rich. The crunchy graham cracker part is yummy too.

"S'mores,Catie,2018-10-10,1,Poor mixture,0,1,""I bought this flavor to try because of the amazing reviews. However, I was really disappointed. There was maybe one or two graham cracker chunks and that was it. The ratios were very off. However, if you like chocolate ice cream, this is the pint for you""";;;

S'mores,Mhoss,2020-03-10,5,Best Flavor Ever!,0,0,This is by far my favorite Ben & Jerry’s flavor! The chocolate ice cream with the graham cracker crumbs and toasted marshmallow is the perfect combination and taste just like biting into a s’more! If only it was available at more locations...;;;

S'mores,Rika,2020-01-16,4,Almost perfect,0,0,I love anything s’mores and this was so close to being perfect. I thought it just needed more marshmallow and graham cracker so it would taste more like s’mores and less like a straight up chocolate ice cream.;;;
"S'mores,bslpeace,2020-08-19,5,I am literally obsessed with this flavor,0,0,""I love this flavor so so so much. I, however, can not find it ANYWHERE. This is really upsetting for me because it definitely deserves to be a more mainstream flavor, so it can be more accessible. Love it.""";;;

"Salted Caramel Almond,CatNamedIceCream,2019-08-06,5,The Ultimate B&J Flavor,0,0,""I have always enjoyed Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, but most of the time, they are a bit too sweet for my taste. The Salted Caramel Almond is perfect. It is sweet, obviously, but not overwhelming. I almost couldn't stop myself from eating the whole pint in one sitting. This flavor needs to be added to the regular rotation!""";;;
Salted Caramel Almond,One For the Road,2019-08-25,2,Hmmmmm,0,0,Not sure what to make out of this flavor. The ingredients say almond slivers. What I got was more like crushed almonds or small almond pieces. They gave the ice cream a 'gritty' texture which was not pleasing to my tongue nor teeth. Not sure if I got a 'crazy' batch but doubt if I will try again.;;;

Salted Caramel Almond,aldahl,2020-06-15,5,Amazing!!,0,0,This is my absolute favorite flavor! Great combination. I would even be happy without the chocolate bits in there because the ice cream with almonds paired with the caramel is amazing on its own. PLEASE never get rid of this flavor!!!;;;
Salted Caramel Almond,DES1980,2019-06-01,1,Disappointing!,0,0,I bought the salted caramel almond because I love salted caramel. The one I purchased really lacked caramel. It was more vanilla ice cream with slivered almonds and chocolate chunks. Did I just purchase a dud?;;;

"Strawberry Cheesecake,brandymaria,2019-09-24,5,,0,0,""This ice cream is breath takingley good!! It taste just like a cheesecake with fresh strawberries in it. I'm so happy to have found this kind because I make a lot of homemade shakes for my family especially on the weekend and when I brought this home for the first time I fixed them some on a Friday night and I looked and it was gone on Saturday night. That's how much they liked it and still like it, I put it in the back part of the freezer and put something in front of it so it will last longer than a day. Lol!

Strawberry Cheesecake,tom_s,2020-07-14,5,,0,0,Im a Huge Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream fan! Its been my favorite brand for as long as i can remember and Im lucky enough to be one of the few places with a B&J's ice cream shop. But this flavor in particular has been my go to for years. Very rarely do i switch it up( unless its a different cheesecake flavor) . they really hit the nail on the head with this one. I have yet to find another brand of cheesecake ice cream that even comes close to comparison with B&J's. Their ice creams are usually around 5-7 bucks for a pint depending on if you get it at a grocery store or a convenience store but its worth the money.;;;
"Strawberry Cheesecake,Beth1981,2019-09-24,5,The Best Strawberry Cheesecake Ice cream!,7,0,""I have been absolutely in love with this stuff every since the first time I tried it about 7 years ago. I have tried other brands of strawberry cheesecake ice cream when the store was out of ben & jerry's brand, and Ben & Jerry's is far superior to those because most of them use a strawberry jelly-like swirl instead of actual chunks of strawberry like Ben & Jerry's.""";;;
"Strawberry Cheesecake,ChrisColby,2018-10-07,3,""Strawberry, not so cheesecake."",7,1,""I love the idea of a strawberry cheesecake ice cream, but only one of those components really shine here. The strawberry flavor greatly overpowers the cheesecake, resulting in what tastes like a sweeter strawberry ice cream than a true hybrid. The graham cracker crumbs are a stand out, but even then, there's not quite enough. A decent flavor.""";;;
"Strawberry Cheesecake,catjthis,2020-06-24,5,,0,0,""Oh my God this is a problem! This ice cream is sooo freaking good I wanna cry! I've walked past this flavor so many times thinking it would be blah. Well is not... it doesn't taste super intense like cheesecake, it a more creamy and sweet taste that's slightly different but way better. Almost like a strawberry milkshake. It has frozen dry strawberries in it and huge chunks of tasty Graham crackers. I literally can't get enough!""";;;
Strawberry Cheesecake,E172,2018-10-07,1,What happened to the cheesecake pieces?!,23,13,This used to be my favorite. I haven't had it in 5 years so when I saw that it had come back I didn't waste any time splurging on it. It tastes almost the same but feels really thick and weird. That's probably because the cheesecake pieces were replaced with cheesecake flavored ice cream. I'm so disappointed.;;;

And I gotta say, I was definitely not disappointed. The base tastes so much like cheesecake..there's the perfect amount of strawberries throughout..and the graham swirl is just enough to be like a crust. Everything about this flavor is perfect. I'm one who almost always adds some type of syrup for a topping, but this one doesn't need anything!""";;;
Strawberry Cheesecake,DeniseJack87,2018-06-09,4,Yummy,3,0,This is my favorite but I would love it even more if there was more crust in the ice cream. Sometimes I may get a pint and there is really no crust at all in it...;;;
"Strawberry Cheesecake,jmarsenault1982,2020-07-26,5,,0,0,""I'm in love with the crust part like little crumbles with strawberries and a vanilla ish ice cream, so it's like heaven in your mouth.

Strawberry Cheesecake,Carla,2019-02-07,2,Strawberry?,2,2,I was really excited to try this flavor because I've never met a Ben and Jerry's product I haven't loved. Unfortunately there is a first time for everything. The graham cracker and cheesecake flavors are so over powering you get no strawberry flavor. The result is so sickly sweet. There is no balance. Really bummed out!;;;

The ice cream base is rich and sweet without being over the top, and the flavor is natural, not cheap and artificial like some other brands going after the same cheesecake profile.

The Tonight Dough,Sarahmarie,2017-08-20,5,In love,11,2,I've been a huge fan of Phish food for 15 or more years. It's been my favorite. But this blew me away. I saw another reviewer state the cookie swirl was too coarse or possibly crystallized. I love the courseness of the cookie swirl it tastes amazing and adds a different texture to all the soft goeyness. I bought and finished this ice cream in the same day. THANK YOU! I always go back to Phish Food. But this I will definitely be going back to.;;;
"The Tonight Dough,,2017-12-12,5,Best icecream I've ever had,13,1,""Haven't been big on icecream in my life time. Only flavor I cared for was cookies and cream. Had no idea I'd LOVE Choc flavor, and mixed with the carmel, such a divine combination. The cookie swirl is mouth watering. The cookie dough is exquisite";" although țhe peanut butter dough is also scrumptious, I could live without much of it in the pint. I've gotten pints with very little of the PB dough, which is heavenly. I've also gotten pints with lots and lots of PB dough, which I find to be a bit overwhelming. Still, it's the flavor I always reach for. Still consider my FAV of all time. Thank you Ben & Jerry's, & Jimmy Fallon for perfecting a flavor so awesome.""";;

"The Tonight Dough,austin1chase,2018-05-23,2,Why did they change the flavor :( :( !!,5,4,""This ice cream is to be our favorite. We probably right once a week for a year. However the last five we have purchased have had a new taste to it of some sort of fruit, and it has ruined the flavor. We waited A few weeks to that that that sent out, and then we went and bought some more , But it was still the same weird through the aftertaste. For the aftertaste doesn't belong anywhere near brownies or cookies or chocolate ice cream or Oreos. It's gross. Please change the recipe back to the original !!!!!!! We have switched to a different brand of ice cream for now.""";;;
The Tonight Dough,LLHh,2018-05-22,2,Excellent...except for weird PB cookie dough,7,9,I purchased tonight dough a few months ago and everything about it was great. This time the PB cookie dough was horrible. It tastes almost like an artificial banana flavor or how I would image nail polish would taste. Here is a photo of the batch numbers.;;;
The Tonight Dough,Andarra,2020-07-06,5,THE BEST ICE CREAM ON EARTH,0,0,I love this ice cream more than any other ice cream on planet earth. There has never been an ice cream that compares to this... If I could keep a giant deep freezer full of The Tonight Dough I would be pretty happy. Eating it makes me feel like Unicorns Dolphins Glitter are flying around my tastebuds. This may be dramatic but it's my addiction.... I can eat it in one sitting.... Its even better as a milkshake using vanilla oat milk. I love it so much. I actually hate chocolate ice cream but this is my major exception...I used to buy this every other day.. so yeah its PERFECT. Also the money goes to a good cause when I buy.;;;
The Tonight Dough,nyfluttergirl,2018-03-30,2,I really want to love it :(,6,1,The first time I bought this flavor it was amazing! But the last few times the peanut butter dough has ruined it. It tastes rancid. I keep giving it chances because I love everything else about it. But I had one last night that was rancid tasting PB again and my pile of PB chunks in the end was about 1/4 of the container worth. I don't believe I'll be giving it any more chances this time.;;;

The Tonight Dough,Kait11,2018-07-31,2,What is Wrong with that “Peanut Butter” Dough?,5,0,This ice cream is great except for the disgusting peanut butter dough chunks that taste like eating a ball of Splenda mixed with dish soap. Seems like maybe there is a bad batch going around? The rest of the pint is great... not sure what’s up.;;;
"The Tonight Dough,TonightDoughisthebest,2017-04-27,5,The greatest flavor ever!,2,1,""I purchased Tonight Dough in a Ben and Jerry's shop hefe in Hawaii a few months ago... OMG it is the greatest flavor I have ever tasted! I am not even an ice cream person, but when I found out that my local grocery store carried the Tonight Dough in pints- I was hooked! The base of this ice cream is mostly chocolate with some caramel ice cream. Then you have globs of chocolate chip cookie and peanut butter cookie dough. There is also swirls of thick chocolate fudge and tiny chuck of chocolate sandwich cookie pieces! The best way to eat this is to let it melt a bit and swirl it all around to mix up the choclate fudge and chocolate sandwich cookie peices. Great Job Ben and Jerry's - and Jimmy Falon! Honestly the only ice cream I will eat!""";;;
"The Tonight Dough,Arliffy,2018-01-02,3,""Awesome except for """"peanut butter"""" dough"",4,1,""This is a great ice cream in almost every way: the ice creams are delicious and the crunchy cookie swirls are awesome. The regular cookie dough with mini chocolate chips is also delicious. I was taken aback by the """"peanut butter dough"""" though - it tasted really artificial, almost a bit rancid? I ate a few and had to pick the rest out. One of my friends was eating it too and felt the same. Please consider changing the PB dough or removing it altogether.""";;;

"The Tonight Dough,FuzzyGut,2018-05-31,4,Almost awesome,2,0,""I really liked most of this one. The ice creams taste great as do all the mix-ins, except the peanut butter cookie dough, which has an extremely strange flavor, and not peanut buttery.

The Tonight Dough,Golfer Girl,2018-03-27,1,This was more PB Dough Than Ice Cream,4,3,I have been trying really hard to stay away from ice cream but saw this on the shelf and thought I have to try it. Boy was I disappointed. First I almost bent my spoon in half trying to break into the ice cream but that was because the cookie dough took over everything. There was hardly any ice cream in this. The dough pieces were very dry and not tasty at all. I really wish I could have liked this one. $5.00 in the garbage.;;;

The Tonight Dough,Mary Lu,2017-07-09,3,Great flavor but inconsistent,1,0,The first time I tried this ice cream it was amazing! I thought it was my new favorite. The second time I tried it it hardly had any cookie dough in it at all and was mostly ice cream. Then the third time I bought it it was loaded with cookie dough (yay) but was mostly all the peanut butter dough which made it too peanut buttery for me. I'm not sure why it would be inconsistent because I've never had that experience with other Ben and Jerry flavors.;;;
"The Tonight Dough,icecreamlover123,2018-09-06,5,AMAZING TASTE!,1,0,""I was never really a big fan of ice cream but that was long before I bought my first pint of 'The Tonight Dough'. Ever since I took a spoonful of this heavenly creation, I've been addicted to eating it. Being a girl is tough for about a full week, once a month. I can now happily spend that week eating this ice cream. It's my guilty pleasure. Thank you, Jimmy Fallon for helping to create the single best thing that makes life worth living.""";;;

The Tonight Dough,Cree28,2017-07-21,3,Mostly Good,3,1,It was mostly good except the peanut butter cookie dough had yucky aftertaste. My husband agreed. Unfortunately most of the chunks were peanut butter so we both had significant collections at the bottom of our pints. Normally I like anything sweet but they really were a bit nasty. The rest was delicious.;;;

Its is sooo delicious and I recommend it to everybody! I had first seen this Ice cream on the tonight show and I kinda thought it was a joke until I saw it at a gas station I quickly picked it up, purchased it, and on the way home with a plastic spoon I found (still in its plastic) I opened it up and enjoyed on the way home. It was sooo good! I have since bought 3 more containers.""";;;

I'm a peanut butter addict and this tasted nothing like any peanut butter I've ever had! Will not repurchase ever.""";;;
"The Tonight Dough,,2020-07-27,5,,0,0,""Favorite. Flavor. Ever. This pint is for those ultimate ice cream lovers. This isnt for a cheat meal...save this for a cheat DAY, because you will not want to stop eating it once you break the seal. It is gloriously excessive in all the right ways: every single bite has loads of cookie dough, peanut butter, brownie, or chocolate cookie chunks, and the ice cream itself is swirled with more chocolate indulgence. Me and my husband buy a pint apiece because we have failed many times to share nicely!""";;;

The major problem is how overpowering the chocolate is: too much raw cocoa flavor. It's way too rich for all those mix-ins. The peanut butter dough is floury and almost sickly sweet, very artificial. There's absolutely no flavor to the chocolate chip cookie dough after being doused in their chocolate base. The cookie core is oddly coarse and, in places, kind of icy.""";;;
"The Tonight Dough,victor,2020-02-07,5,Cookie Doughs Best Ever,0,0,""The cookie doughs in this pint are better than I've ever tasted in other flavors. I think in particular it's the peanut butter cookie dough that WOWed me to death. The sweet caramel ice cream and the less sweet chocolate ice cream balance quite nicely. Before I tried it, I wrote """"The Tonight Dough"""" off as too busy and probably not good, but now it's def like my favorite Ben & Jerry's.

When a carton of half baked is placed in my freezer I know it will not last more than a week! I absolutely love this flavor! It has a perfect hint of saltiness in the dough and creamy sweetness in the ice cream! This is far superior to half baked because the different doughs in this mixture are much better!;;;

"The Tonight Dough,Icecreamfan4life,2018-06-22,4,Interesting Mix,0,0,""Bought this a couple nights ago on a whim. Had seen it plenty of times when I was looking at other flavors to try out, as I'm not typically a real big chocolate ice cream fan do to the bitter taste it can have at times. But I've found that I really enjoy B&J's chocolate ice creams. Very smooth and light flavor. So I finally opted to break down and chose to buy this flavor. And have to say that I wasn't quite unsatisfied with it. I mean the chocolate and caramel ice creams came together beautifully with the chocolate chocolate chip cookie swirl. But I have to admit there was something off with the peanut butter cookie dough. I have no idea, if they taste off, do to possibly being made from a vegan recipe. But, I could very faintly taste the peanut butter as well as some kind of floral-esque note at the end. Was kind of strange tasting. I think maybe if the recipe was adjusted a bit or maybe just adding a peanut butter swirl or core to this pint, would really make everything come together.""";;;

The caramel-filled truffles: silly yummy! If you need lots of caramel flavor with several different textures (and some nice chocolate, too) as I often do, then this is the ice cream for you! It’ll put a nice big smile right on that mug of yours, and when was the last time you turned down a little extra happiness?""";;;
"Triple Caramel Chunk,RB2020,2020-09-12,2,""Ice cream is good, but where is the caramel?"",0,0,""I would expect a flavor called """"Triple Caramel Chunk"""" to have more of a pronounced caramel flavor. The chunks were few and far between and the caramel swirl was pretty much absent. I wanted something that looks like the picture used in your glamor shots, but got something a lot closer to plain light-brown ice cream with a vague caramel0sh taste. Nothing at all like it's advertised to be.""";;;

"Triple Caramel Chunk,barryf,2017-08-21,3,where are the chunks?,0,1,""First off, the ice cream tasted great. The problem is with the quantity of the chunks. In the pint I bought there were 4 chunks and i expected much more since many of the other great Ben and Jerry ice creams are loaded with treats.

"Triple Caramel Chunk,AK Catherine,2017-06-13,3,""Good flavor, gritty texture."",0,1,""I was very excited to try this flavor of ice cream, however I was saddened that the ice cream wasn't rich and creamy like Ben & Jerry's usually is. The flavor was there, but it had a gritty texture. I tried to power through but after 1/4 of the pint I gave up, I couldn't get past the texture. :(""";;;

"Triple Caramel Chunk,EZ Doesit,2020-09-08,5,Savor Suggestion,0,0,""I read the review by Sara H.

"Urban Bourbon,Odie McGoo,2017-07-24,5,My New Favorite,17,0,""I recently found this at my local grocer and was a little skeptical since I like bourbon (I'm from KY so by law I have to) but I'm not a big fan of caramel. I decided to give it a try but still bought my go-to flavor, Chunky Monkey, just in case this bourbon and caramel infused ice cream wasn't my cup of tea. Despite my reservations I instantly fell in love with this ice cream and now keep a pint stocked in my freezer at all times. the caramel bourbon flavor is smooth, not to rich, and the almonds pieces pair well with the flavor and chunks of chocolate. Well done Ben & Jerry. I reall hope this flavor stays in the lineup for a long while.""";;;
"Urban Bourbon,GuiltyVargoIceCreamLover,2017-08-20,5,Wow...omg wow!,6,0,""It is SO good! I've been trying out new flavors instead of my stand by of chunky monkey or mint chocolate cookie. I have liked most and loved 3. But this one knocks my number one out! im not usually a Carmel fan especially the gooey kind (i usually go fudge) but wow! The only thing that I would have done differently is the nuts, i think pecans would have been in keeping with the southern theme ihis has going. But yes, I know, there is aways the pecan pie, which was just a like in my book.""";;;
"Urban Bourbon,ksgirl79,2017-09-19,5,Yum!,4,0,""On a particularly lonely Sunday while I was shopping I decided to grab my normal flavor """"Everything But The..."""" to give myself a little treat. Then I saw this flavor staring at me. Carmel, Almonds, and Bourbon oh my! SOLD! I hurried thru dinner so I could rip open the container to get my first spoonful. Its creamy burnt carmel taste hit me first and I couldn't stop. The almonds and chocolate made for great trio of flavor but then it happened... I hit the bourbon carmel center. Oh my goodness my mouth waters just thinking of it. I promptly took a pic and sent it to several friends telling them to find some for themselves right away. Thank you B&J for yet another addiction.""";;;
Urban Bourbon,Ja_Ja_jason,2017-04-30,5,OMG!!,7,0,Yet another amazing flavor to come out of the Ben & Jerry's flavor laboratory. I had to hide it from the wife so she wouldn't eat mine.;;;
"Urban Bourbon,Sweettooth,2017-07-08,1,Disappointed,4,18,""I normally love B&J, even if I don't love a flavor I try, I can still appreciate it. But not this time. First of all, the almonds are like flavorless splinters. The bourbon swirl tastes like bananas. And generally I like ice cream with chunks in it, but this was so overrun you can't even enjoy the ice cream. I'm whining about it because B&J might want to count the votes when deciding whether to keep making this flavor. I'm sure lots of people will try it, but I doubt you'll get a lot of repeat customers. But thanks for making such awesome ice cream (aside from this) and by the way my boyfriend LOVES your chocolate cherry Garcia. I do to. Hope you'll keep making it!""";;;
"Urban Bourbon,bikelvrgirl,2017-08-10,5,FABULOUS,3,0,""This flavor is simply not your ordinary ice cream. I enjoy a good helping of Boom Chocolatta Cookie Core now and then, but sometimes I just don't feel like something super sweet and chocolate-y. This flavor has a little bit of everything. Chunks: check. Sweetness: check. Saltiness: check. Rich, dark undertones of something mysterious: check. I love the balance of the darker, rich flavors with the salty, sweet flavors. This is the BEST! All I can say is, they better not ever get rid of it! It's addicting!""";;;
"Urban Bourbon,Curlysea87,2017-04-29,5,Yum yum yum!!,6,1,""I was a little worried about buying a new flavor because I have bought a few lately that I haven't liked and I didn't want to be let down again. But my favorite flavor is no longer available so I took a risk on this one and boy am I glad. I can't put my spoon down! The almonds, fudge flakes and caramel swirl dance in your mouth and while sometimes you get a bit of the bourbon taste it is not overpowering! Great work guys!!""";;;
Urban Bourbon,Nance,2017-05-23,5,Just what I needed!,5,1,So happy my husband got this for me to try! He knows I love bourbon. I really love this flavor! I think u did it just right! Don't think I will share this pint. Maybe the next one. Which there will b plenty of because this is hands down my new favorite!!!! I am not a huge fan of caramel either so I was a little skeptical. But this is the perfect blend of the caramel and the almonds and the chocolate and the bourbon flavor all together. Yummmmmmmmm Nice job <3;;;
"Urban Bourbon,Arianna,2017-08-07,1,Disappointed :(,2,2,""I was bugging my mom about how much I wanted Ben & Jerry's so when my mom took me to the store I was staring at the frozen doors drooling and I was looking at all the flavors and my usual """"half baked"""" wasn't there so I grabbed Urban bourbon because it sounded delicious!! I went home and started eating it and it didn't have any flavor, all it tasted like was coldness overwhelmed by the tiny almond shreds. The only pleaseant part about this ice cream was the Carmel swirls. I wish I bought the bob Marley ice cream !! But I still love Ben & Jerry's no hate""";;;
"Urban Bourbon,Ashley547,2019-09-13,5,The best Ice cream I have ever had!,0,0,""My stepmom first introduced me to this flavor of Ice cream, and after my first taste I fell in love. I’ve been buying this flavor for about a year I think now and it never gets old! Recently I’ve heard some rumors saying that the Urban Bourbon flavor is going to be discontinued? Since I’ve heard that, I’ve been buying 3-4 tubs of it every time I go to the grocery store. I know there are thousands and maybe even millions of reviews out there, but if you happen to stumble across mine I would like to ask...could you could possibly keep Urban Bourbon as a permanent flavor? Thank you Ben and Jerry!""";;;
"Urban Bourbon,Sharon2802,2019-08-01,5,OMG -- my new favorite since Dublin Mudslide,1,0,""I instantly got addicted to this new flavor. I've been sad about Dublin Mudslide going to the graveyard for years, but I may have just found something at least equally good. Yes, it's sweet (caramel swirls), but not as sweet as any of the 'core' pints or Phish food that I do not like at all. Urban Bourbon is such a delicious combination of flavors! With the crunchy almonds, and chocolat bits it is really perfect to me. Chillin' the Roast and New York Super Fudge (one of my go-to's) seemed bland after Urban Bourbon.""";;;
"Urban Bourbon,bingobungo,2017-08-24,5,The Best Caramel Ice Cream Flavor,2,0,""The ice cream is what counts - all the extras thrown in aren't going to compensate for ice cream with no flavor. This ice cream has a complex, full bodied, intense caramel/bourbon taste and is loaded with flavor notes. The thick dark chocolate flakes and almond bits accent the flavor. This was excellent - so much better than the grainy flavorless taste of the coconuts for caramel flavor. I love it.""";;;
Urban Bourbon,Traumatized by Bourbon,2017-09-11,1,Had me gagging!,2,0,The flavor sounds great in theory but it seems like it's a challenge to make consistent flavoring and distribution of ingredients. My point contained too much of a large center swirl of bourbon that was overly sweet and had me gagging. I couldn't even enjoy the perimeter and ended up tossing the entire pint before guzzling almost a liter of water! Definitely has kinks that need to be worked out.;;;
Urban Bourbon,stupidhobbits1,2018-04-15,4,Tasty but there's no alcohol,0,0,I love the flavor and texture but was a littke annoyed when i did some research and found there wasn't any real alcohol in it even though it lists whisky as one of the ingridients. Was hoping to at least get a little buzz but was disapointed. Thought it was ice cream for grown ups but i guess not.;;;

"Urban Bourbon,Paxeth,2017-04-10,4,nice combination of flavors,2,0,""despite the name there is no """"alcoholy"""" flavors. the base ice cream is delicate, the fudge chunks are rich in flavor as always, I wish there was a bit more almonds in it though as you don't get nuts in every bite and I LOVE almonds but the creamy caramel swirl smoothed me over. delicious!""";;;
Urban Bourbon,Casey k,2017-07-15,5,Best Ever!!!,2,0,I purchased this a few days ago and now I'm hooked! This is my FAVORITE ice cream! I used to go to Bruster's a lot to buy ice cream but this one puts everything they have to shame! Thanks so much for this wonderful new flavor and I hope you keep this one on the market!!! :);;;
"Urban Bourbon,Suzanne,2017-09-30,2,I will never know,0,2,""Let me begin by saying that I am a serious B&J fan, lately consuming whole pints in a day. Unfortunately, as far as this flavor is concerned, epileptics like me don’t dare try it because of the whiskey (even in tiny amounts, alcohol is a very potent seizure trigger). A recovering alcoholic friend of mine said the same thing, that it could trigger a craving that could undo all his work. Delicious ice cream is not a good reason to spend a night in the hospital. Assurances from B&J isn’t enough, folks, how about an alcohol-free version? (I don’t even like bourbon very much, but a gin-flavor will probably do me in, LOL.)""";;;
Urban Bourbon,Chenson,2017-07-01,5,Awesome taste!!,2,0,I am loving the new flavors. By far this ia my favorite. im not big on chocolate in my ice cream so i was skeptical on this flavor. To my surprise its perfect! Tiny little flakes and perfect amount of almonds. The bourbon taste is spot on not to overwhelming but noticable.;;;
Urban Bourbon,handerson286,2017-04-19,5,So yum!,2,0,Just found this in the freezer at my in-laws' and I gave it a try. Usually caramel is so sweet in ice cream but this was unlike anything I've had before. The balance of flavor was perfect. The chocolate flakes and almonds were plentiful in every bite. Highly recommended!;;;
"Urban Bourbon,Brodiecat,2017-04-23,5,Addiction in a pint,2,0,""This stuff is amazingly good. And addictive. I chose this new flavor on a whim, not to my boyfriends liking. He is now addicted.

Urban Bourbon,Yvonne,2017-05-05,5,Perfection!,2,0,I tried this flavor when it arrived on the shelves at my grocery store. I am HOOKED!! The amount of almonds and chocolate chunks pairs exactly with the burnt caramel and bourbon. I can't imagine a more perfect icecream!!!!;;;
"Urban Bourbon,Bostbosox,2017-08-13,5,Addicted!!,2,0,""Can't get enough! Love it. The burnt caramel base flavor is awesome, almonds and fudge the perfect mix ins, but the whiskey flavor is the straw that stirs the drink. Awesome""";;;
"Urban Bourbon,jessh,2018-04-10,5,Not your typical ice cream fix,0,0,""I bought this flavor on a whim one time when stocking up on my most recent favorite the Tonight Dough. I was shocked, the burnt caramel flavor mixed with chocolate and bourbon flavors was an instant hit the minute it hit my taste buds. I am normally a chocolate ice cream kind of gal through and through. But this was sooo good and different from anything I had ever had and it still cured that sweet tooth of mine. I've already bought this several more times and introduced it to so many friends who love it as well! In this case change is a good thing!!""";;;
"Urban Bourbon,Ima Scooper,2017-07-14,5,Soooo Happy!!!,2,0,""While I still mourn the passing of Tennessee Mud long ago my new boozy ice cream headache fix is Urban Bourbon. It's a fun mix of sweet, burnt and boozy!""";;;

It’s really actually quite good when it gets a little melty. The ice cream flavor itself is somewhat subtle and the fudge chunks are really great. The bourbon caramel swirl is delicious! I will definitely buy this flavor again.""";;;

Urban Bourbon,KellyDEN,2017-07-14,5,Love it!,2,1,LOVE this flavor. Ben & Jerry's knocked it out of the ballpark. I picked this up at the grocery store because it's new and I like caramel. When I got home I attempted to take a taste of it and ended up eating half the pint! I love the unique bourbon and caramel flavors and the crunch of the chocolate and almonds.;;;
"Urban Bourbon,Dejota,2017-08-22,1,If I could give zero stars,3,2,""If I could give zero stars, I would. I love Bourbon but this ice cream was gross.

"Urban Bourbon,Puck,2018-10-18,1,Too much burnt flavor,0,0,""I wanted to love this flavor. EVERYTHING in the ingredients were things that I liked individually. Except... the 'burnt caramel ice cream'. All I can taste is that burnt flavor, sadly, and it overwhelms everything else. I understand wanting to try a combination that isn't so sweet in every aspect... but sadly, the burnt aspect of it drowns out the other elements to the point I can't taste anything else in much the same respect that several of their coffee flavored iced creams do for me. A shame.""";;;
"Urban Bourbon,Paul55,2017-05-26,1,No distinct flavor,2,1,""I bought this for my husband who loves anything bourbon flavored. He couldn't wait to try it and was very disappointed.

Urban Bourbon,Nannerama,2018-01-31,5,What I've been looking for!,1,0,I just bought this tonight and am happily surprised. I have been going from flavor to flavor and brand to brand looking for just the right chunky and carmelly combo. And the bourbon is the cherry on top! Thank you for making the best out there.;;;

Urban Bourbon,LadyD,2017-05-01,3,A tweak could make it better,1,0,This ice cream is ok. I think if it was made with salted caramel and a few less almonds it would be great. The bourbon swirls are tasty. I was a little disappointed in this flavor.;;;
"Urban Bourbon,Beekeeni,2017-07-22,1,Too sweet and too burnt,8,14,""At about the second bite, on top of the extreme sweetness, there's a strong overly """"toasty"""" taste. I felt that they overplayed the burnt caramel. At least there's soft notes of nuttiness at the end.""";;;

"Urban Bourbon,Cerie,2018-03-06,5,Please keep this one!,0,0,""This is my absolute favorite Ben and Jerry's flavor. I'm worried with some of the negative reviews that this flavor might get pulled, but please don't! I don't really understand some of the other reviews that are basically calling for this to be pulled from the shelves because some of the flavors are more unique. Everyone has different tastes, and I'm sure they would be perfectly satisfied with something like triple caramel chunk, why does that mean urban bourbon has to go? Part of the reason I love Ben and Jerry's is because they have more creative flavors than the typical chocolate, vanilla, caramel etc. you find with other brands. There's nothing wrong with liking basic caramel and cookie dough flavors, they're a classic for a reason, but I don't understand why everything on the market has to fit into that cookie cutter mold.""";;;
Urban Bourbon,Dawnatella,2017-05-23,3,Is 2.5 an option?,1,1,Omit the almonds and this would be a 4.5! The almonds are tiny and get in the way. The hinder the flavor. I like when ice cream is smooth going down. Now it feels grainy. The flavor otherwise is good and the bourbon caramel is amazing. The chocolate is slightly too dry. I think they need to use the phish food fudge recipe instead.;;;
"Urban Bourbon,Reese,2017-07-06,4,""Great flavors, but..."",1,1,""Bought a pint 3 days ago, love the flavors, but the almonds are too finely chopped for me, they get stuck in the corners of the mouth & in between teeth.

"Urban Bourbon,,2017-12-11,5,Sooooooo goood!,0,0,""My wife brought this home. She drinks bourbon, I do not. This is by FAR our favorite flavor ice cream! Even though I don't drink, you can really taste the bourbon in the caramel. But it's not a bitter alcohol taste. And the dark chocolate chips are the perfect sweet/bitter combination to compliment the burnt caramel and bourbon. Not too overly sweet like most ice cream. I really hope this flavor is around for a really long time!""";;;
"Urban Bourbon,Dana,2017-06-08,2,Disappointed,1,1,""I usually love Ben & Jerrys but I was disappointed with this one. Everything in the ice cream including the bourbon flavor had actually sank to the bottom of the container.

Urban Bourbon,Saucydragonfly,2018-04-18,5,its My favourite flavour and I’m a connoisseur!,0,0,This is absolutely my favourite Ben and Jerry’s flavour...I can’t tell you how mn\any pints of this I’ve packed away in the past two years! It’s not overly sweet but the flecks of almond and perfect crunch to the dark chocolate. I’m addicted to the caramel swirl... I’m telling you as a Ben and Jerry’s fan - YOU MUST TRY THIS FLAVOUR okay I’m off to buy some more okay thanks bye;;;

"Urban Bourbon,jjcovarr,2017-10-05,2,Not the best flavor,0,0,""I was really when I saw this flavor. I was debating between Phish Food and this one. I have had Phish Food before, so I gave this one a try. There seemed to be a lack of flavor and it didn't really have an ice cream taste to it. It was not horrible, I was just nor impressed with it. I usually like the new flavors that Ben & Jerry's release, but this one just did not cut it.""";;;
Urban Bourbon,Yackersmaren,2017-08-23,5,HOLY YUM!!!! DID I SAY YUM??? YES YUM!!!,1,1,Urban Bourbon is my new favorite. The flavors just melt together in a happy little dance in your mouth. It was all gone before I knew it!!YUM YUM YUM!!!!;;;
"Urban Bourbon,Rwntree,2017-07-28,5,""Not perfect, but well worth a try"",0,0,""Not a perfect replacement for my old favorite, Bonnaroo Buzz. But it's still great. In reality this is a 4.5 stars for me, but that's not an option. The reason: not enough Bourbon flavor. It's there, but you really have to try to find it. That really is the only downside for me. All things considered, this is a nice blend and I hope it stays around a while.""";;;
"Urban Bourbon,Two Spoons Johnny,2017-12-14,5,Best Caramel Ever,0,0,""I am not an avid caramel consumer, but this product has converted me, at least for ice cream.

"Urban Bourbon,musicalmystic,2017-10-06,2,Not what the title suggests,0,1,""I was really looking forward to this flavor. I am a huge fan of Ben and Jerry's and a huge fan of bourbon, so it seemed like a dream come true. Unfortunately it was not at all what I'd hoped. It was so different than I expected that I actually bought a second one just to make sure"; alas, both were the same. First off the ice cream didn't have that caramel taste one associates with bourbon;" to me it tasted like coffee ice cream. It wasn't bad tasting, it just wasn't bourbon flavored. Also there were a LOT of chopped almonds in it, so many that it completely dominates the taste and texture of the ice cream. It seemed as though half the volume of the carton consisted of almonds. Now if they had labeled this """"Almond Ice Cream with mild coffee flavor"""", at least I wouldn't have gotten my hopes up. Again, it's not bad (if you like nuts in your ice cream, which I don't), but it's not bourbon either. There are lots of Ben and Jerry's flavors I crave";" this is not going to be one of them."""
"Urban Bourbon,kabrion,2019-01-07,5,What a flavor.,0,0,""I bought this because it sounded weird enough to be good and it was way better than good. It is nutty, sweet, slightly burnt but not overwhelmingly so, the chunks and swirls were perfectly balanced with each other and the ice cream. 12/10. I will cry myself to sleep id it should ever be pulled from shelves.""";;;

Urban Bourbon,AmyM,2017-05-25,5,Urban Bourbon Oh How I Love You!,0,1,Just bought it today. Tried a spoonful and was skeptical it wasn't going to really taste like Bourbon. I was proved wrong. It's deliciously sinful. I do wish you could omit the almonds and add more bourbon. Well done!! Maybe B n J should try something with Bailey's or a Tequila Margarita ice :);;;

Urban Bourbon,Kate,2017-04-18,5,Totally Unexpected,0,0,Just tried this flavor and it is great!

"Urban Bourbon,adelina,2017-10-19,1,""Sounded great, but dissapointed."",0,1,The ice cream & swirl were good. But the almond bits were like little annoying tasteless splinters.

It’s creamy, dense, sweet, rich and very natural tasting. It’s the essence of Vanilla";" very intense. It also has a great mouth feel. Yes, it isn’t full of chunks, swirls and mix-ins but that doesn’t mean it’s boring. On the contrary, each bite is an exploration of what it means to taste true Vanilla. Honestly it’s the best.""";;
"Vanilla,joank,2018-04-17,5,Best vanilla ice cream out there,5,1,""My favorite ice cream flavor is vanilla. Simple, sweet, savory, creamy, delicious vanilla.

Although I’ve noticed lately the cookie “core” isn’t much of a core anymore rather than just a little piece. I’m pretty disappointed as I’ve gone far enough to write a review. I posted a picture to show how small it’s become. This is with me eating around it, by the way.""";;;

The consistency of the cookie core is in an interesting one....smooth enough, but not exactly """"cookie-like,"""" however, this does not mean it is not good. This ice cream can become quite a bit as you move towards the bottom of the pint, but I think if you're a seasoned ice cream veteran you could power through to the end. I do however wish there was a bit more vanilla to counteract the cookie core and mocha flavors, but this isn't exactly a complaint";" perhaps my pint had a somewhat skewed ratio of vanilla:cookie:mocha.""";;

Defeated, I searched the flavor and came across the locator page on the website and found not one, but ten different places nearby had it! Tears were shed, angels sang, the day was quite literally saved by Ben and Jerry, and their Boom Chocolata flavor. Thanks so much""";;;
"Boom Chocolatta,FuzzyGut,2018-11-27,3,50/50,5,2,""I love both sides of the ice cream! Both absolutely delicious! The mocha is to die for and the chocolate cookie and fudge flakes make for great textural and flavor components. That’s the first ‘50’ in the title of my review. The second ‘50’ is the core. While it was thick and went all the way to the bottom, the flavor is just frankly very unpleasant in my opinion. The texture of the core is also strange";" gritty, grainy, hard and pasty. If this were a standard pint, not a Core, it would be a total knockout 100% awesome pint which I would buy regularly. As it is though, I think I’m done.""";;

I could live without the fudge chips, but the rest of the concoction is above reproach. The caramel side is delicate & flavorful all on its own, the mocha side is a fantastic coffee kick with subtle notes of rich chocolate. The chocolate cookie core is very true to delicious cookie consistency, I did not find any issue with the texture or taste, and I'm very sensitive. This may well be my favorite Ben & Jerry's flavor ever. I'll weep hysterically in the streets if it is discontinued. 11/10 stars""";;;

Boom Chocolatta,Dragonborn,2017-11-08,2,Acrid flavor in cookie core,1,5,This particular flavor was disappointing because the cookie core and cookie chunks were an acrid flavor.

Boom Chocolatta,Karah,2017-07-16,5,Cookie core gets me every time,1,0,I feel so bad for all the other flavours because I can't go past this amazing combo. The cookie core is hard but crumbly when applied with enough pressure and the texture is kind of gritty - it's fantastic! i try hard not to eat it all in one go but I can't stop the cookie train once it's started.;;;
Boom Chocolatta,Fire1180,2017-04-12,5,Exquisite,1,0,The Exquisite taste as well as texture all goes so smoothly with each other that it makes the perfect combination of an extreme delightful explosion of taste in your mouth.

When I bought this for the first time, I just couldn't stop buying it. The caramel ice cream with the chocolate mocha ice cream is such a perfect combination. It's so good to the point where I couldn't even make it home to freezer I had to eat it on the way. I would purchase it everyday if I could but it's so hard to find where I live in the country.

The core in the pint I purchased was super small, making it a total disappointment. I kept digging hoping it would get bigger and it just ended up almost disappearing. The ice cream as always was delicious, but I felt I would’ve been more satisfied with my old favorite standby, half baked.""";;;
Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Core,ramsey92,2019-04-03,2,soo disappointed,44,2,i am so upset that this didnt meet any of my expectations. the cookie “dough” is just grainy sugar! not to mention i get more cookie dough out of a regular ben & jerry’s cookie dough or even half baked than what i got in this. this needs a reboot! please consider making the core out of your oringinal cookie dough recipe!;;;
Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Core,Tillamookicecreamisbetter,2019-04-03,1,Is this a joke?,20,1,I was so excited for this because I love cookie dough but there’s never enough. I thought the core would look how it’s advertised. Spoiler alert: It didn’t. Barely any dough. Didn’t go all the way through consistently and couldn’t even be in the center. Also the dough didn’t taste great? Idk why but I like the vanilla better. Should have read the reviews first it was such a let down and I feel like I wasted my money.;;;
"Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Core,abclementine,2019-03-21,1,wish it was better,47,3,""Even after reading all the reviews that said it wasn't good I still went and bought it anyways because it looked & sounded so good, but sadly the reviews are right. most of the time with cookie dough ice cream I wish there was more cookie dough (i thought this would be the super cookie-doughy flavor i always dreamed of.. theres not even that much in it), but with this pint i actually prefer the part around the core that doesn't have any. ben & jerry if u see this please re-make this flavor with better quality cookie dough, it had so much potential""";;;
"Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Core,Phish Food Fan,2019-04-14,1,Heartbreaker,43,1,""I preordered this as soon as they announced that it was available in the online store. I was so excited to dig in but while the ice cream is delicious, the cookie dough core is terrible. Rock hard, gritty, sandy, and very inconsistent in size from the top of the pint to the bottom. I hate having to write this review, especially because the other 2 new cookie cores were pretty good, but this one is REALLY dreadful! I’m really bummed because I wanted badly to love it.""";;;
"Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Core,APMNSNW,2019-02-28,1,Disappointed,46,1,""I waited and waited for this to be available at my local store. Yuck. Hard, grainy cookie dough core?

"Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Core,Icecreamlover1,2019-02-27,1,Let down,49,2,""Such a let down from Ben and Jerry’s. The cookie dough core was hard, dry, and basically tasted like granulated sugar. I am so underwhelmed by all the cores but this one was by far the most disappointing. Stick to the regular pints: my opinion best flavor is Gimme S’more.""";;;
Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Core,Mickey4,2020-09-08,1,Tasted like sweet sand.,50,4,Bought this last night and was incredibly disappointed. Never write reviews but don’t buy this. The cookie dough was literally like sweet sand. It was gritty and grainy. Threw us away after about 5 bites. I’ll stick to the original Cookie Dough.;;;
"Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Core,Magnus,2019-02-27,1,The core was a disappointment!,18,0,""I bought this, excited to try it as cookie dough is my favorite. Well the core was rock solid. It had to be eaten in 1 huge chunk instead of mixing with the ice cream. Very disappointed!""";;;
"Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Core,Deanne,2019-04-25,1,An overhyped disappointment,1,1,""I will not buy this again. It's good ice cream, but the """"core"""" is a joke. People buy cookie dough ice cream for , surprise... the cookie dough. This """"core"""" tastes like grainy sugar and shortening and not like cookie dough at all. And there's less than ever. The company found a way to give customers less if what they want with the hopes that all the hype about """"new and improved"""" sways people. Well, I'm not fooled and I believe most others won't be either. It's overpriced and a big disappointment. I repeat, I will not buy again.""";;;
Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Core,anghearts,2019-03-07,2,Good if you like eating brown sugar,16,1,I just bought this with very high expectations because the regular Cookie Dough flavor is amazing. The cookie dough core tastes like pure brown sugar. I would definitely not buy this again unless they made it taste like the original cookie dough flavor.;;;
"Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Core,BNJ4LYFE,2019-06-05,1,Simply AWFUL - Who signed off on this?,5,0,""The idea sounded so amazing, so I did not think it could possibly be as bad as the reviews said it was...Well I was wrong, it is actually worse. The ice cream itself is fine, but the core tastes like just brown sugar crystals. Not even remotely the same flavor or texture as their normal cookie dough. Did someone actually taste this before signing off on it? This is a total miss and anyone who was fooled into buying it should be provided a refund.""";;;
Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Core,ePtiOnO,2019-03-17,1,Huge disappointment,3,0,This is not the same flavor as the well known Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough.;;;
"Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Core,Mandie,2019-04-22,1,Not much cookie dough,1,0,""I bought this at target because they didn’t have the original cookie dough I liked. It’s not good y’all. The dough seems like a new recipe. It’s got an odd texture, like sugar grains didn’t mix well and the chocolate chips are weird. The worst part is there’s not enough weird dough compared to the vanilla ice cream. I hope the old cookie dough hasn’t been replaced with this!""";;;
"Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Core,John A,2019-05-20,1,""Great concept, horrible execution"",1,0,""I was really excited to see this in my grocer’s freezer. Having had karamel sutra core with its strong ratio of caramel to ice cream, I thought it would be great to get a nice glob of cookie dough going down the center of the pint. Instead, I was left incredibly disappointed with hardly any cookie dough in the entire container. Even worse, the dough included seemed to be dry and crumbly compared to what I’m used to in regular cookie dough. Very disappointing, I won’t be buying this one again unless they improve the formulation and increase the cookie dough. Worst b&j pint I’ve ever purchased.""";;;
"Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Core,Happy wife happy life,2019-03-31,1,This is horrible,3,0,""The regular chocolate chip cookie dough is my favorite and has been for YEARS, its soooo BOMB!! This iteration of it is absolutely disgusting the cookie core is not dough its literally just sugar, and it doesnt even go throughout the entire pint, not even half, not even in the center , its the grossest thing .Some of the other cores are really good which is why i gave this one a try but how could you get chocolate chip cookie dough wrong . I dont normally write reviews but I felt like i HAD to warn someone.""";;;
"Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Core,pirple,2019-04-07,1,Could've been better.,3,0,""When I first heard this flavor was coming out I was so excited. I waited 4 weeks to get my hands on one of these and finally found one yesterday at Wawa. I read the reviews before purchasing this, but decided to give this the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately, everyone was right. The cookie dough has a sandy texture and crumbles to pieces and it doesn't taste very good either. Plus the core didnt even go all the way to the bottom of the container...definately wasn't worth the $5.99 I paid for it. :(""";;;
Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Core,Lyss27,2019-03-12,1,Extremely disappointed,6,0,Wow I love ben and jerrys but this one is sad. I debated between this one and another core one but chose this one due to my love of cookie dough. Well I wish I read the reviews first because they were incredibly right.

"Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Core,bjoy917,2019-04-26,2,""Good ice cream, subpar dough"",2,1,""At first I thought my taste buds were off, but no...the dough really just tastes (and feels like) brown sugar. Also, the bottom part of my pint had an air bubble, so it was hollow. Overall very disappointing. I'll just stick to the B&J's regular cookie dough ice cream!""";;;
Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Core,Mns1275,2019-03-28,1,Save your money for a better pint,5,0,I was soooooo excited to try this!! Then I did and immediately wished I got something else. The ice cream was good but the supposed cookie dough core was like eating brown sugar and chocolate chips. It was so nasty that I ate around it. Truly disappointed....I have never been let down before so I guess there is a first time for everything.;;;
"Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Core,Hv234,2020-01-21,1,Disappointing Core,0,0,""I've never gotten a cookie dough core pint from Ben and Jerry's, but I'll never buy this again. I was expecting it to look the way the caramel core does when you open it, but instead there is such little cookie dough it would've been better to just get a regular cookie dough or half baked pint. If I'm going to spend $5 for a pint, I would at least like to get what is advertised. The same happened with my boyfriend's brownie batter core so this is not just a one time thing, but a consistent problem.""";;;
Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Core,Sammykr,2019-04-02,1,Disappointed,5,0,I have been waiting for this to come out at my grocery store. The minute I could buy it I got it. I was really upset. Like many others have said the cookie dough core is sandy and grainy. I was thinking it was going to be like the cookie dough in the normal ice cream. Really upset about this.;;;
Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Core,Katsad,2019-03-25,1,Grainy and barely there.,2,0,I am a loyal fan and this is the one and only flavor I have thrown away. The pictures make it look amazing and I understand it’s for marketing so variation is expected. That being said the “core” is almost non existent. The bottom half of the ice cream had absolutely no core. The top half had a small chunk. The cookie dough that I did get was grainy and had a funky taste. It wasn’t cookie dough that’s for sure. The ice cream itself was creamy and had a nice flavor but I’m so disappointed that this was such a flop.;;;
Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Core,,2019-03-28,1,Cookie dough is very grainy,6,0,Not at all like non core cookie dough which is soft and tastes really good. The core tastes terrible and has a very hard grainy texture. Not good!;;;

Tried it and threw the rest away! I love cookie dough ice cream and thought this would be great, only to be extremely disappointed! The vanilla ice cream is almost tasteless, and the cookie dough """"core"""" was absolutely gross. It had none of the flavors I would expect from cookie dough, basically just sugar with a few chocolate chips. Plus, the core was half the size of the other flavors!

The ice cream really does taste like cookie milk. I’ve never had anything like it; so yummy. but the star is the core. PERFECT texture and EXCELLENT flavor. The ice cream and the core together are a match made in heaven. It’s sublime. I hope this stays for a long time.;;

WRONG the cookie dough is not in the middle( which is not a big of a deal) and the cookie dough is gritty and taste like sugar it’s horrible. The reason it has a 3 stars is because the cookie milk ice cream is to die for, it’s just the cookie do is disgusting. This best thing if you do get this is eat around the cookie dough core""";;;

Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Core,Sadmomma13,2020-08-06,1,Buy the regular cookie dough version!!,0,0,Bought this today and was so disappointed! Cookie dough is nothing like in the reg chocolate chip cookie dough. I thought at first maybe it was supposed to have some kind of swirl in it and never found the cookie dough core like you find with the brownie batter version! It’s awful esp if you thunk your getting the cookie dough like in the reg or the bites. I would give it one star but it won’t let me.;;;

While the ice cream itself was delicious ( the only reason I didn't give this 1 star), I was completely disappointed by the cookie dough core part. It was gritty and just not good.

"Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Core,Coley00,2019-02-24,3,Meh. Nothing special.,3,1,""I gave this product a 3 just because I like cookie dough. I felt like this was no different than the regular chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream. I would have liked to see more cookie dough, like maybe a chocolate chip cookie dough with a cookie dough core, maybe a half chocolate half vanilla.. I think then that would have made more sense. All the other core pint flavors are more special and different this one was boring and basic... not my favorite unfortunately.""";;;

Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Core,Adpqwe,2019-11-30,1,DO NOT BUY,0,0,my brother picked this up on accident instead of the regular one. This was horrible.

Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Core,hockey15,2019-06-11,3,Good but could be better,0,0,I was so so excited to try this because I love cookie dough ice cream. On one hand I want to give this product five stars because the ice cream was delicious and I personally loved the cookie dough in the middle. On the other hand I want to give it one star because it was not what I was expecting and I was still disappointed. I was really hoping for a bigger cookie dough core and I expected for there to still be chunks of cookie dough in the ice cream portion. I was hoping that this new product would finally be ice cream stuffed with cookie dough that I’ve been waiting for.;;;
Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Core,SLange,2019-04-02,1,Should have trusted the bad reviews,1,0,Totally disappointed in this flavor. I love Ben & Jerry’s cookie dough. But the cookie dough core was terrible. First of all the core was more like a cone getting smaller the more you dug down and it didn’t go all the way down to the bottom of the pint. And the cookie dough itself was terrible it was grainy and didn’t have the same taste the cookies dough usually has. It tasted like it was heavy on brown sugar or something. It just wasn’t right. Anyway I was sorely disappointed.;;;
Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Core,Jesspttn,2019-10-21,2,Taste very good but....,0,0,This is really good ice cream and I've had a few. However they need to put more cookie dough in the core. There is never enough. Never goes to the bottom of the carton or very little amount;;;

We were so excited to hear about this new flavor, however once we tried it we were disappointed that the core isn't cookie dough at all, but rather more like a cookie butter. It's sugary and not doughy. This was a disappointment, however it still taste good. The cookie dough ice cream is better.

Well yesterday, I asked my mom could she buy me any Ben and Jerry’s I’ve Cream that had cookie dough in it and this is what she brought me, my immediate reaction was “oh no.” But hey, I didn’t mind trying it! Fast forward to when I opened the pint, there was cookie dough in the center and pretty thick(obviously you can see it in the picture) and was like, oh wow! So I decided to eat the ice cream first and I noticed it really tasted like a cookie had been soaked in some milk for about three minutes, and I was shocked because it tasted amazing! I got to the dough and remembered how one person stated it had a grainy texture, so I dug in and it did, but it didn’t really bother me THAT MUCH, it still tasted a bit like cookie dough, so I just scooped some of the dough and icecream together and that kind of made it better, I also remembered how some people said there was barely any in there but mine was PACKED with dough and it was so much that in some areas, the dough was showing more than the icecream itself! I would totally buy this again and put some of their cookie dough bites inside to make the ultimate cookie dough core flavor there is! 4/5 rating!""";;;

I don't think I've ever been this disappointed in a Ben and Jerry's flavor. The cookie dough they use for the core is completely different in the worse ways. It's mushy and taste like garbage. It's salty and weird tasting. I like lots of different kinds of cookie dough. I don't think I've ever tasted any kind of cookie dough that I've hated before. Until now. How did this pass taste testing? Good thing there was hardly any core anyway so I can still eat the ice cream part.;;;

The """"cookie milk"""" ice cream just tastes like regular old vanilla but with a slightly weird taste and extremely weird aftertaste. The """"cookie dough"""" core (which, in my opinion, is supposed to be the best part and main attraction) was horrible! Did NOT taste like cookie dough AT ALL! Even the texture was so, soooooo off! Just like all the other reviews say - TASTES LIKE SWEETENED SAND! Now don't get my wrong - I am usually a HUGE fan of B&J's - however this particular flavor just is completely so far off from the quality I've come to know and love, and expect from this brand.

But I am beyond disappointed in this. First I will say that the cookie milk ice cream part is DELICIOUS. I wouldn't change anything about the cookie milk ice cream. However, I was looking forward to a big center of that same delicious cookie dough that's in the other pints of ice cream (like the half baked). But instead, after digging through all the cookie milk ice cream I found a tiny little section of cookie dough, not even a core. Just a chunk on the side of cookie dough that isn't even actual cookie dough. It LITERALLY tastes like sugary sand and has a grainy texture. Nothing like the cookie dough I always enjoy in the other flavors.""";;;

I've been silently waiting for cookie dough core Ben & Jerry's and this one outdid any expectations I had. All of the flavors (almond, cherry, sugar cookie, shortbread) taste like happiness on a pink cloud of soft fatty calorie heaven. Would definitely eat an entire pint in one sitting to cope with my depressed emotions again. Hoping to also eat part of a pint in one sitting while I'm happy to experience the flavors in a different mood so I will update when that happens.

Sweet Like Sugar Cookie Dough Core,Ash9,2019-03-30,5,Love <3,3,0,Wow. I bought this as I quickly saw something new on my way out the store and I’m glad I did. I’m not a huge chocolate fan so it’s so nice to get a non chocolate flavor!! Both “sides” are great.

Once I finally got my hands on it.... it did not disappoint! This is the most delicious ice cream ever, the almond flavor is spot on and the cherry side is loaded with luscious, large cherries. The sugar cookie dough core is wow, just wow. I love the texture of grainy sugar in a sugar cookie and this hit it right on the nail.

It is amazing! Very seldom do you taste an ice cream that is so subtly crafted, so much thought went into this one. Each of the defining characteristics plays well with each other (the cherries, the shortbread, the almond flavor, the sugar cookie), though none is overpowering. You keep going back from one flavor to another, then appreciating each even more upon return. A sense of deep creaminess and vanilla tie everything together. Great texture. If there were a comparison to be made to a layered and multi-dimensional chocolatey dessert, this would be the decadent vanilla counterpart. So satisfying, you’ll be scooping up any available pints at your local grocer before someone else finds it... I know I have. Bravo.""";;;

I've never seen her finish a pint by herself before. I tried it myself and its super good, I normally don't like cherry flavored stuff but the cherry is mild and not artificial tasting at all. The almond is really good, but the sugar cookie core is the real star of the show. I say this icecream suits someone with a more sophisticated palate.""";;;
"Sweet Like Sugar Cookie Dough Core,,2019-04-27,4,""Fruity, creamy, nutty and sugary. Yum."",0,0,""Out of the 3 new cores flavors from B&J's, this one is the best. The cherry ice cream with cherries is just as tasty as in Cherry Garcia. The new sweet cream with a hint of almond flavor is extremely accurate. The almond flavor is there, adding a nuttiness to the taste while not being overpowering. And the core, while just as grainy as the the chocolate chip cookie dough pint, is at least more fitting of a sugar cookie and tastes accurate to the real deal. It's not a set of components that you'd ever imagine together, but it works. Delicious.""";;;

The sweet cream base with that subtle hint of almond really blends well with everything else. The smooth creamy texture mixes really well with the sugar cookie dough core and the slightly grainy texture. The cherries add yet another texture and a bit of tartness as well.

I've probably bought more than ten so far. Cherry and almond flavors are well-balanced and lovingly tied together with shortbread cookie.

I cannot quit thinking about it. It’s a sandy, almost gritty (not in a bad way—in an I cannot quit thinking about that mouthfeel way!) sugar cookie dough texture and the contrast of that against the soft smooth flavors of the ice cream..I literally cannot quit thinking about it. I just discovered this a few weeks ago and have been through three pints. I have never had any ice cream like it. I am not seeing it restocked so I’m afraid it’s discontinued and I’m going to be devastated. I’d been buying ALDI’s generic Cherry Garcia because, it’s just BETTER, sorry for the blasphemy but it’s the truth. And this brought me back to the brand. I hope it’s restocked soon.""";;;

Anywho, Ben & Jerry's, a sincere thank you from the bottom of this girl's brownie lovin' heart.""";;;
"Brownie Batter Core,mary27,2018-07-28,3,""Great ice cream, okay core"",0,0,""This was my first time purchasing this flavor and although the ice cream itself was really good, the core flavor was a bit disappointing compared to the other core flavors I normally get. The brownie batter core didn't go all the way to the bottom, and it was very bitter and tasted like artificial fudge. The core itself was the only thing wrong with the ice cream, everything else tasted amazing. I love the brownie and vanilla ice cream.""";;;
"Brownie Batter Core,PrincessDemandyPants,2017-11-25,1,To the graveyard!,0,0,""Oh no! There can be too much of a good thing and this flavor proves it. Chocolate Therapy manages to be ooey-gooey and over the top chocolate mayhem without being intensely sweet. The same cannot be said for its chocolate cored partner-in-crime, brownie chunked friend. If you can figure out a way to temper the evil Dr. Sugar, you may have a winner. If not, consign it to the graveyard to spare humanity.""";;;
"Brownie Batter Core,Kcbella64,2020-07-02,4,Favorite Flavor,0,0,""Didn't realize that icecream this good existed, unfortunately there was an air bubble at the bottom that robbed me of a fair chance at happiness. I'd also like to add that this has one of the lowest ratings on here yet when I went back to the store to get more, it was all sold out. So if yall are giving low rating to keep ppl away I fear its too late.""";;;
Brownie Batter Core,Cassi7321,2019-09-03,5,Cheat Day Favorite,0,0,This is definitely among my go-to Ben&Jerry’s flavors. The gooey chocolately brownie batter is perfect to really treat yourself after a long week. And I love that the actual icecream isnt overly sweet so that once the batter gets to be too much I can give my taste buds a refreshing break. Seriously its so decadent and I always have a craving for this;;;
"Brownie Batter Core,Kenzie,2020-01-17,3,Great!.. Until you get to the bottom,0,0,""This one is by far my favorite, but it has a terrible draw back! The Core is supposed to be the best part, don't get me wrong it is, but it is a small part that should be alot more than just a bite. At the bottom its just chocolate and vanilla ice cream. I just wish the browies and core were all throughout the pint like it is advertised.""";;;
Brownie Batter Core,Faeli,2017-10-11,1,Freezer burner beyond recognition!,0,1,I am SO DISAPPOINTED. I'm sick and sent my bf to the store for ice cream and got the brownie core... it's so freezer burned I don't even want to bother with it! I've never had the brownie core so this is really disappointing. Not to mention it mentions fudge brownies in it and I have not found a single one. I'm giving up on it.;;;
"Brownie Batter Core,Jb1777,2018-09-01,3,""Very Tasty, core lets it down."",0,0,""I buy this regularly as it is my favourite flavour. However, on multiple occasions of me buying this the core has been pretty disappointing. I find that the never really seems to go down to the bottom or even halfway. It’s more like a fat blob at the top and nothing more. Overall, it tastes very nice but the core lets it down.""";;;
Brownie Batter Core,JJ419,2019-04-15,1,Kind of Disappointing,0,0,I kept hearing so much great things about Ben & Jerry's ice cream flavors. This is the first one I ever tried and it was disappointing. I was really looking forward to have brownie pieces but I think I found like 2. The rest were like crumbs. The core was barely there too. I'll try another one but this wasn't worth it to me.;;;
"Brownie Batter Core,Mirevas,2020-08-31,3,Love the flavors but they’re so inconsistent,0,0,""I’m new to Ben n Jerry’s and so far have gotten 2 brown batter cores and 1 chocolate fudge brownie. I absolutely love the flavors but the cores for both didn’t go all the way down and for the fudge brownie, there weren’t any fudge brownie pieces until I reached the halfway point so it was kind of disappointing""";;;
"Brownie Batter Core,Tbreanne,2017-08-11,4,MORE CORE!,0,0,""This is the best ice cream flavor, and the core is the best part. But halfway through the core just stopped, and it's very disappointing since getting the gooey core in every bite is what makes this ice cream the best ice cream there is! Seriously just needs the core all the way through!""";;;
Brownie Batter Core,Haileeey,2020-03-09,5,100% my favourite flavour,0,0,This is hands down my favourite flavour. The only way it could be improved is by replacing the vanilla ice cream with more chocolate haha! BUT the Australian Ben and Jerry's has stopped selling it here so now it exists only in my dreams..... No other flavour matches up in my opinion;;;
"Brownie Batter Core,jakevett9,2018-05-12,5,AMAZINGGGGGGGGG,0,0,""I just had this flavor last night! The core was so thick and gooey just like brownie batter! My core ran all the way to the bottom.

Brownie Batter Core,JamieG2020,2018-07-08,2,Where is the core?,0,0,Fudge Brownie is my absolute favorite flavor as well as the boom chocalata cookie core one so I decided this flavor would be the holy grail!! But only 1/3 of the pint had the core part opposed to the other flavors that I’ve tried having core in the whole pint! Why is this?;;;
Brownie Batter Core,Stevi,2017-08-02,3,Love the core till it was gone,0,0,I love several flavors of Ben and jerrys ice cream I just recently tried this flavor and fell in love but all 3 pints I have eaten i too have missed the core not even half way through. It ls amazing but not near as amazing without the core!!! Definitely needs more!!!;;;
"Brownie Batter Core,PapaSmurf,2017-11-26,3,Good but not great,0,0,""It’s hard to ever give a bad review on Ben and Jerry’s ice cream, but I am going to try. As far as brownie goes, I only got little hints, but the core was great. The brownie flavor was good, just not enough of it. As always, the ice cream was still very enjoyable.""";;;
Brownie Batter Core,lilianna,2018-02-25,5,Amazing!!,0,0,I love this ice cream!! I have actually never had a problem with the core because whenever I buy these the core goes all the way to the bottom.

I haven't had this issue with other core flavors, so it seems to be unique to this flavor. It would be perfect if it reached the bottom!""";;;
Brownie Batter Core,liyah21,2019-09-09,1,Upset customer,0,0,I buy brownie batter core about 3-4 times a week and for about the past month every batch has dried out brownies and it’s literally disgusting. Haven’t had a good batch in a month! And i hate chocolate and this actually made me like chocolate.;;;
Brownie Batter Core,Elaine B,2018-02-19,3,I can't get rid of all these muffin stubs!,0,0,This is a great ice cream. The only negative is the brownie batter core only goes 3/4s the way down. Leaving the 1/4 usually going the dog. Still well worth the purchase. Thank you guys for making the best ice cream in the world.;;;
"Brownie Batter Core,Karen,2017-11-18,5,Best Flavor Ever,0,0,""The year 2017 has been all about Brownie Batter when l find it on Sale l buy all the store has twice. Unfortunately, l have to have one every night and my weight shows it. So, l decided to give up food so l could have my ice cream.""";;;
Brownie Batter Core,Iceeeeeeekreamm,2019-05-30,1,Bland,0,0,Tried this out hoping for a little bit of a variety in the chocolate and vanilla taste. All I got was a bland chocolate with not much else. If the texture and chocolate flavor itself had even a slight variation it would be ok.;;;
"Brownie Batter Core,mpg1904,2018-08-01,3,Not enough core,0,0,""I decided to try a new flavor and while the flavor was delicious, the core did not go to the bottom of the container. It ended about 2/3 of the way down which was disappointing because that was the best part of the ice cream.""";;;
Brownie Batter Core,Sydsm,2018-12-05,1,DISGUSTING,0,1,Please tell me why the brownie core is probably the worst taking brownie batter possible? First of all the viscosity is wayyyy off! No brownie batter is that this/ taste like the fakest chocolate on earth. Never getting again;;;
"Brownie Batter Core,Jake3469,2019-10-18,5,So good,0,0,""I don’t know why this one is rated around only 3 1/2 - 4 stars, it is honestly so good! It’s basically a hot fudge sundae mixed with brownies. Honestly one of their best flavors, I absolutely love it, and recommend highly""";;;

"Brownie Batter Core,Eleah911,2020-03-14,5,❤❤,0,0,""This is my fave flavor. The core tastes more like fudge than brownie batter, but I love it! Sometimes the core doesn't always go all the way to the bottom though, wish it would! Aside from that, I could live off it.""";;;
"Brownie Batter Core,Mads,2018-07-22,2,Bring back the brownie batter swirl,0,0,""I bought this one after not seeing the brownie batter flavor out anymore, which was clearly made with real brownie batter. This tastes more like and has the texture of a brownie that went soggy then got froze :(""";;;
Brownie Batter Core,Dejota,2017-08-23,4,pretty good,0,0,Pretty good ice cream but overall could be better executed. I love most of the core ice cream lines even though each series seems to be a re-run of previous series. Still a good product and will buy in a pinch.;;;
"Brownie Batter Core,MegS,2018-08-28,2,Great potential!,0,0,""I loved loved the bites that had some of the core or brownie bits. Sadly, those bites were limited. The core was short lived and I maybe found 2 brownie bites. It was more just vanilla and chocolate ice cream.""";;;
Brownie Batter Core,Banana1128,2019-09-25,2,No core,0,0,This is the second pint that I’ve bought and both times there was no brownie batter core. Just small amounts here and there. The ice cream was still good but I was looking forward to the brownie batter core!;;;

Brownie Batter Core,IzzyBella,2017-12-07,1,Sad,0,0,I knew I was taking a chance on this bc of the mixed reviews. The core only went 1/3 of the way thru and the brownie chunks were too hard. I love Ben & Jerry's but I'm disappointed with this one.;;;

Cookies & Cream Cheesecake Core,The Jellyman,2017-11-22,5,Awesome core!,2,0,I got this at Walmart and it was epic! The chocolate ice cream is sweet and the cheesecake ice cream tastes similar to vanilla. The chocolate cookies add a really good crunch and texture to the creamy ice cream.

"Cookies & Cream Cheesecake Core,Austin98,2017-11-11,1,Really?,2,9,""I'm the type of person to never write a review, especially when it's for some ice cream... As i put the first spoon in my mouth i waited for the great taste of Ben & Jerry's but instead got the weakest flavor i think i've ever tasted. If this was repackaged and sold as a single spoon of nesquik in a gallon of water flavour i might have actually thought twice about paying for this super overpriced rubbish. It's not like i went into it wanting it to be bad. I'm the least fussy eater i know, and i don't think i've ever disliked Ben & Jerry's, or ice cream in general. It's not that the flavour is bad it's just so weak. The bargain supermarket brand chocolate ice cream tasted more like chocolate than this. Also the core tastes about as much like cheese cake as Gatorade tastes like almond milk... Guess what it doesn't. This ice cream is great if you find mayonnaise spicy. 0/10.""";;;

"Karamel Sutra,Cait5,2018-11-11,3,""Good flavor, but not enough caramel"",1,0,""The caramel flavored ice cream is ok--it would be better as vanilla. But the combination of the chocolate flavor, the chocolate chunks, and the soft caramel core is delightful!! The only problem is that the caramel core *always* stops halfway through the pint, rendering the other half of the pint completely and totally worthless. The last pint I got, my boyfriend grabbed one small bowl of it, and there was no caramel left at all after that--there should be way more caramel since this flavor can really only be enjoyed by one person, one time before the rest of the pint is ready to be tossed. Again, good flavor, but poor execution. I would highly recommend it if there were more than a dollop of caramel.""";;;
Karamel Sutra,lottybee91,2017-06-13,3,Disappointing,5,0,I used to love this but the last few times ive bought a tub the core stops halfway down! :-( so disappointing as the core is the best bit. The bottom half of the tub is boring! Wont be buying it anymore.;;;

I hope this isn’t the new normal and it’s just a quality control issue.;;;

I've seen alot of other comments from people having similar experiences with karamel sutra ranging from only 1/2 the amount of caramel the pint should have all the way to what i experienced which was absolutely no caramel.

Peanut Butter Fudge Core,LitaLo,2018-06-14,5,Peanut Butter delight,4,0,I have been buying this guy over and over. My freezer is always stocked with this flavor. The only bad thing Ihave to say is that not all contents of containers are created alike. Some have a lot of pb cups and some others lack those mini peanut butter cups that I love so much. I wish for more pb cups and less fudge core. Otherwise this is perfection;;;
Peanut Butter Fudge Core,chocho22,2018-04-16,5,Chocolate and Peanut Heaven,2,0,I bought the Peanut Butter Fudge Core yesterday and the moment the ice cream touched my tongue I was in heaven. This ice cream is now one of my favorite ice creams ever!! Thank you for creating this ice cream.;;;
Peanut Butter Fudge Core,Brittbrat,2019-03-11,2,Lacking,3,1,I eat ice cream for the yummy things that are in it (pieces of peanutbutter cups in this case) unfortunately I might have had in total 1 whole peanutbutter in the entire pint. Very disappointed as I love peanutbutter cups but with so very little in it I don't think I'll be getting this one again.;;;
"Peanut Butter Fudge Core,slogirl,2018-11-15,3,Could be better,7,8,""I have bought this 3 times now, so you could say I'm a fan. I love the two different ice-cream flavors, but the core tastes fake and processed to me. I was hoping that maybe I just got a bad batch but now that my third one tastes the same I think this is the real flavor. Re-invent the core flavor and this would be a 5-star.""";;;
Peanut Butter Fudge Core,Lyss24,2019-03-13,5,New favorite flavor,1,0,I bought this today after trying the cookie dough core pint which was highly disappointing. This one is 1000 times better and my new flavor. Two things I would change- more pb cups because when are there too many pb cups?? And the core didn't go all the way down;;;
"Peanut Butter Fudge Core,TreeDancer,2018-01-28,5,""Holy cow, so good"",1,0,""I wasn't expecting something this satisfying, it's perfectly balanced and no peanut butter cup will ever be worth it ever again, this ice cream has ruined me for any other brand.""";;;

"Peanut Butter Fudge Core,Sanford,2018-08-29,5,The Best Flavor,0,0,""This is my favorite ice cream flavor -- if this is in the store, I will never walk out with another flavor. If they don't have it, sometimes I'll walk another block to check another store or two. It's that good. Great balance, so it feels very rich instead and never too sweet. Both sides of the ice cream are equally compelling, so there are no disappointing bites. I hope this flavor sticks around for a long long time.""";;;
"Peanut Butter Fudge Core,Marley,2019-08-14,5,Awesome Flavor,0,0,""I can eat peanut butter, but I'm not a huge fan. In the store one day, they were out of my favorite (Half Baked). One of the few remaining flavors on the shelf, I bought the Peanut Butter Fudge Core. This stuff is so addictive, and I just can't get enough. I love the fudge core, and I love the tiny peanut butter cups. It's a perfect blend of flavors and textures. Beyond YUM!""";;;
